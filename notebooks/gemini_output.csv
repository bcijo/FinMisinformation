,"In mid-January 2024, a viral video purportedly showed a participant at the 2024 World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, saying [expletive] you onstage to WEF Chairman Klaus Schwab.Many online users reposted the video, including this post in French with the caption: A guest like no other, Damon Imani on stage at #WEF in Davos.Some people appeared to think the video was authentic. It is a work of satire, however, as pointed out by Imani, the original creator and the man in the video. In a post below the original video, he wrote, Satire but true. This video is also available on Rumble here and Klaus Schwab can go f himself. Based on that statement, and the lack of any evidence at all confirming the incident happened, we rate this claim as Labeled Satire.Posting on X after his video gained more attention, Imani complained about the language of the community note being placed under his original video, writing, I've requested additional review. Even the language of this CN is laughable; 1. It links to my own notice. Duh! 2. Makes opinion based argument that I can't use ""breaking"" for something that's not breaking. This is a straightforward hijack of Community Notes to demonetize a very smart immigrant.This is not the first time we have fact checked false claims involving Schwab. The WEF, as we have reported in the past, is an influential, international, non-governmental organization known for fostering private-public partnerships around economy, international development, and more. The organization, which Schwab founded in 1971, is the target of many conspiracy theories surrounding its real-life ties to elite networks that online rumor-mongers believe are nefariously planning to create totalitarian regimes.For background, here is why we sometimes write about satire/humor."
"The label ""NEI"" (Not Enough Information) accurately reflects the situation regarding the Biden administration's bank reporting proposal. While the justification provides detailed information about the proposal, including its purpose, scope, and potential impact, it doesn't offer conclusive evidence to definitively label it as true or false.

Here's why:

* **The justification highlights conflicting viewpoints:** The justification presents arguments both for and against the proposal, with banks expressing concerns about privacy invasion and increased costs, while proponents argue for increased tax revenue, improved enforcement, and enhanced data security. 
* **The proposal is still under negotiation:** As acknowledged by Speaker Pelosi, the specific details of the proposal, including the $600 threshold, are subject to ongoing negotiation. The final form of the proposal might differ significantly from the current draft.
* **The long-term impact is uncertain:**  The justification acknowledges that the effectiveness of the proposal in deterring tax evasion and raising revenue is unclear, and that the costs associated with implementation might outweigh the benefits.

Therefore, based on the information presented, it is not possible to conclusively label the claim as true or false. The proposal's ultimate impact on bank reporting and taxpayer privacy remains uncertain, making ""NEI"" the most appropriate label. 
","Announced in April 2021, U.S. President Joe Bidens American Families Plan is an ambitious proposal that aims to expand Americans' access to childcare and education and increase the number of women in the workforce. The plan is to fund all of this through more taxes on higher-income earners and increased reporting requirements of banks that could potentially yield more tax revenue. These reporting requirements have caught the ire of a number of banks that took issue with this less widely known section of the plan.A Facebook post by FNB Community Bank claimed: The Biden administration has proposed requiring all community banks and other financial institutions to report to the IRS on all deposits and withdrawals through business and personal accounts worth more than $600 regardless of tax liability. This indiscriminate, comprehensive bank account reporting to the [Internal Revenue Service (IRS)] can soon be enacted in Congress and will create an unacceptable invasion of privacy for our customers.The Independent Community Bankers of America (ICBA) even began a campaign, calling on communities to send a letter to Biden to prevent this so-called intrusive proposal"":We looked up the proposal itself, and it does require more robust reporting of transactions across business and personal accounts. The proposal, which aims to go into effect after Dec. 31, 2022, states:We begin by explaining some of the more technical terms in this proposal. A ""de minimis threshold"" is broadly defined as the amount of a transaction that has such a small value that accounting for it would be unreasonable. We spoke to Visiting Assistant Professor of Tax Law at New York University, Nyamagaga Gondwe, who explained, ""It is the amount below which the [IRS] would argue isn't worth investigating. It's the difference between your company giving you a $5 card to Subway, versus traveling on a private jet on your company's dime. [The latter] is worth reporting."" In this case, ""gross flow"" refers to the aggregate inflows and outflows of cash from bank accounts. In sum, the current proposal stipulates that an aggregate amount of less than $600 worth of cash flowing into and out of accounts is not worth reporting. The ""fair market value"" refers to the amount people are willing to pay for an asset in the open market. In this case, Gondwe argued, the use of the term could possibly refer to the changing market value of transactions more than $600 that may occur in foreign currency transactions. The ICBA claims that the proposal will make banks report ""all transactions"" above the limit, but this is misleading. While it is true that the IRS will have more information on cashflows above $600, that doesnt mean they will have all the information pertaining to all transactions. The Center for American Progress (CAP) points out that banks will only be providing aggregate numbers to the IRS after each year  gross inflow and gross outflow  and not individualized transaction information. This reporting requirement would also extend to peer-to-peer payment services like Venmo, but wouldnt require people to report any additional information to the government. According to The Wall Street Journal, financial institutions must already report interest, dividends, and investment incomes to the IRS, and the IRS can get other information through audits.According to Marie Sapirie of Tax Notes, a publication focused on tax news, a parenthetical to the proposal indicates that there is some flexibility on raising the minimum account balance/inflow/outflow above $600.The Tax Notes report also states that the treasury department estimated this form of reporting would raise $463 billion over the 10-year budget window, making it the third largest revenue raiser proposed in the budget. The aim is to target businesses outside of large corporations that carry out gross underreporting of their income in the amount of $166 billion per year. According to the proposal: Requiring comprehensive information reporting on the inflows and outflows of financial accounts will increase the visibility of gross receipts and deductible expenses to the IRS. Increased visibility of business income will enhance the effectiveness of IRS enforcement measures and encourage voluntary compliance.Banks claim this would be an invasion of consumer privacy, with the ICBA saying it would allow the government to monitor account information. However, CAP analysts Seth Hanlon and Galen Hendricks argue, Only the prior years total inflow and total outflow would be reported on annual forms. No one would say that the IRS monitors you on your job because it receives a W-2 from your employer with your total wages every January.Another challenge not mentioned in the ICBAs consumer alert is the higher costs this reporting proposal may place on banks. In May 2021, a coalition of banking associations wrote a letter to the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance, arguing that they already give a lot of data to the IRS, and that this would impose additional costs on their systems:On the flipside, Sapirie wrote for Tax Notes, the benefits of such a reporting proposal may be difficult to come by:But CAPs analysis argues that this will help prevent tax evasion, while also providing more funding to enhance data security for consumers:On Oct. 12, 2021, Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended the proposal in response to a question from a reporter, who said, ""[Banks] are concerned about the tracking of transactions that are greater than $600, Americans are starting to get worried about this. Do you think [this] is going to stay in the Reconciliation Bill?"" "
,"The protracted, often bloody Israeli-Palestinian conflict exploded into a hot war on Oct. 7, 2023, when the militant Palestinian group Hamas launched a deadly attack on Israel and Israel retaliated by bombarding the Gaza Strip. More than 20,000 people, the vast majority of them Palestinians, were reportedly killed during the first two months of the war alone. The violence is driven by mutual hostilities and territorial ambitions dating back more than a century. The internet has become an unofficial front in that war and is rife with misinformation, which Snopes is dedicated to countering with facts and context. You can help. Read the latest fact checks. Submit questionable claims. Become a Snopes Member to support our work. We welcome your participation and feedback.In January 2024, as Israels bombardment of Gaza continued, a pair of photographs went viral showing the apparent impact of the violence on Gazas universities.Al-Azhar University in the north of the Gaza Strip was targeted by Israeli forces in particular, and since late 2023, a number of posts on Reddit, TikTok and X appeared to show what the educational institution looked like ""before"" and ""after"" it was hit by Israeli strikes.In November 2023, Al-Azhar University shared the before and after images in a Facebook post detailing the destruction that took place on the university campus after bombardment from Israel. One picture in particular showed the ""before"" version of the untouched building for the Faculty of King Hassan II For Environmental Sciences and Agriculture.We found images of this particular building from different angles in years prior including from the Moroccan press agency in 2021 that detailed a new specialty for Veterinary Medicine had been made available at the university. A news release from the Kingdom of Morocco noted that the facility had been reconstructed with Moroccos help and was inaugurated in 2015.On Nov. 22, 2023, Reuters published the photograph of the same building after it was destroyed, with the caption: The remains of Al-Azhar University of Gaza is seen, amid the ongoing ground operation of the Israeli army against Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, in the Gaza Strip, November 22, 2023. [...] EDITOR'S NOTE: REUTERS PHOTOGRAPHS WERE REVIEWED BY THE IDF AS PART OF THE CONDITIONS OF THE EMBED. NO PHOTOS WERE REMOVED.Geneva-based Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor, an independent nonprofit organization, said Israel was systematically destroying universities in Gaza in stages, with the first stage including the bombing of the Islamic and Al-Azhar universities.Getty Images also published photographs of other Al-Azhar University buildings that had been destroyed by the bombardment. A New York Times interactive from Dec. 12, 2023, mapped out all the neighborhoods with satellite imagery that lay in ruins from thousands of Israeli strikes and the ground invasion. Switching between the Before and Now tabs in the interactive, visible damage can be seen on Al-Azhar Universitys campus, as well as the noticeable Israeli tanks in the courtyard.The Israeli military said they had destroyed buildings on Al-Azhar Universitys campus because the Hamas terror organization used the university building for the purpose of fighting against our forces.They claimed to find: terror infrastructure, including an underground tunnel that ran from the university's yard and [continued] to a school one kilometer away. Furthermore, numerous weapons, including explosive devices, rocket parts, launchers, explosive device detonation systems, and several technological assets were located and taken for an intelligence analysis and investigation.According to an Al Jazeera report, in more than 100 days of Israeli bombardment, hundreds of schools, including those run by the United Nations, had been bombed and students and teachers killed. Centers of higher education, including universities, have been completely paralyzed and according to Wafa, a Palestinian news agency, 12 institutions of higher learning have been either damaged or destroyed.Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor said the Israeli army killed 94 university professors along with hundreds of teachers, and called the attacks an intentional destruction of Palestinian cultural and historical properties including universities, schools, libraries, and archives."
"The label ""False"" is accurate because the claim that Biden's Build Back Better plan imposes a new mileage tax is incorrect. The Justification explains that the plan does not impose a new mileage tax; instead, it includes a pilot program to study the impacts of a mileage tax. This pilot program is designed to explore alternative revenue streams for surface transportation programs as the Highway Trust Fund, traditionally funded by gasoline and diesel fuel taxes, is seeing declining revenue due to factors like electric vehicles and decreased personal travel. While the pilot program may pave the way for a potential mileage tax in the future, it does not currently implement one. Therefore, the claim is misleading, and the label ""False"" is justified. 
","Biden's Build Back Better plan does not impose a new mileage tax. These rumors appear to be based on a misinterpretation of a section of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act that is currently (as of October 1, 2021) making its way through Congress. The infrastructure bill does not impose a mileage tax. Rather, this bill proposes a ""national motor vehicle per-mile user fee"" pilot program to study the impacts of a mileage tax. Andy Winkler, director of infrastructure projects at the Bipartisan Policy Center, told The Associated Press: It is not a tax, it is not on everybody and it is voluntary.""One of the purposes of this pilot program to explore alternative revenue streams to fund surface transportation programs. At the moment, the Highway Trust Fund is largely funded by taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel purchases. With the rise of electric vehicles, cars with better miles per gallon, and decreased personal travel during the COVID-19 pandemic, revenue from the gas tax has declined. One solution to this funding problem is to raise taxes on gasoline purchases. The state of Missouri, for example, just increased the state's gas tax for the first time since the 1990s. Another option would be to shift the burden of funds from the amount of gas a person uses to a person's actual mileage. Back in March 2021, Transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg said:While proponents of a mileage tax argue that it's a fair tax, as it will tax people based on how much they use the roads, opponents have argued that this tax could impact people in rural areas more as they typically have to drive longer distances. Others have also raised privacy concerns, questioning how a person's mileage use would be calculated."
"Former President Obama's statement that the Senate bill ""hands enormous tax cuts to the rich and to the drug and insurance industries, paid for by cutting health care for everybody else"" is **Mostly True**. 

The Senate bill does indeed offer significant tax cuts, particularly to wealthy Americans and the healthcare industry. This includes repealing taxes on investment income, high earners, and medical-related businesses. While the exact cost of these tax cuts is still being determined, estimates suggest they could reach $1 trillion over ten years. 

While the statement is a bit hyperbolic in saying ""everybody's"" health care would be cut, it is accurate that the bill primarily impacts lower-income individuals and families. These cuts include:

* **Reduced subsidies:** The bill changes the formula for calculating federal subsidies for lower-income Americans purchasing insurance, resulting in a 15% reduction and higher premiums for those individuals.
* **Repealed cost-sharing subsidies:** The bill eliminates subsidies that helped lower-income individuals pay for deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses.
* **Medicaid cuts:** The bill changes federal funding for Medicaid to a per capita cap or block grants, reducing funding for the program, especially in states that expanded Medicaid under Obamacare.

Therefore, while the bill does benefit some groups through tax cuts, these benefits come at the expense of reduced healthcare access and affordability for lower-income Americans. While not directly cutting ""everybody's"" healthcare, the bill does disproportionately impact lower-income individuals, making the statement **Mostly True**. 
","The Senate bill hands enormous tax cuts to the rich and to the drug and insurance industries, paid for by cutting health care for everybody else, Obama wrote in a Facebookpost.We should also note that middle- and lower-income consumers would likely see benefits from tax cuts in the form of lower prices and reduced fees on health savings accounts, as we pointed out inan earlier check of a House version of the bill.Compared with the Obamacare formula, the Senate GOP version would amount to a15 percent across-the-board cutin premium subsidies, andresult inlow-income people paying higher premiums for bigger deductibles, according to Larry Levitt, senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health care think tank.Separately, starting in 2021, the Senate bill begins a three-year phase out of enhanced funding given to the 31 states (plus Washington, D.C.) that expanded Medicaid under Obamacare. As we noted in aprevious check of the House bill, reducing this funding would likely cause states to end expansion."
"The label ""False"" is accurate because the provided image of a yacht with a golf course is a fabricated image. The justification explains that the image is a manipulated photograph, starting with an image of an aircraft carrier and then adding elements like a lawn, golf hole, clubhouse, and ultimately a golfer figure with the name ""Tiger"" across the bow. The claim suggests Tiger Woods owns this large yacht, which is incorrect. The justification further clarifies that while Tiger Woods has purchased expensive yachts in the past, the image in question is a hoax. 
","time.  (In 2006, Forbes listed Tiger at #5 on its ""Top 100 Celebrities"" power rankings, estimating his income from tournament winnings and endorsements at $90 million.)  The linkster also enhanced his reputation for big spending and extravagance in 2006 when he shelled out a reported $38 million to purchase a 10-acre waterfront estate in Jupiter Island, Florida.  (Perhaps not coincidentally, it was right around then that photographs of an opulent Hawaiian beachfront rental estate began circulating via e-mail mistakenly identified as pictures of ""Tiger Woods' house."")Finally, many people who inquired about this image probably recalled Woods' name being associated with a big, expensive yacht, as Tiger plunked down a reported $20 million in 2004 to purchase a 155-foot craft.  (Several news outlets also reported the somewhat amusing coincidence that Woods, who named his yacht Privacy, filed a privacy-rights lawsuit against the yacht's builders, claiming they used his name and image in promotional materials without authorization. The suit was settled in Woods' favor for a reported $1.6 million.)"

"The claim states that Mike Martinez supported increasing taxes, utility rates, and discontinuing free bus services for senior citizens. The justification provides evidence that Martinez did vote for these measures.  

* **Taxes:** The justification shows that Martinez, as a city council member, voted for an increase in city property taxes during his tenure. While he argues that this was due to economic recession and surging property values, the fact remains that he voted for the increase. 
* **Utility Rates:** Martinez supported a rate hike for Austin Energy, the city's electric utility, in 2012.  This resulted in increased electricity costs for residents.
* **Bus Services:** Martinez, as chair of the Capital Metro board, voted to charge senior citizens a 50-cent fare for bus services, ending their previous free ride status. While he argues that this was due to a state panel recommendation to improve Capital Metro's finances, the fact remains that he voted in favor of the fare increase.

Therefore, the evidence supports the claim that Mike Martinez supported these policies, making the label **True**. 

However, it is important to note that the justification also provides some context and nuance.  Martinez did not act alone in these decisions, and his actions were often influenced by external factors like state mandates or economic conditions. This information is crucial to understanding the full picture and should be considered when evaluating the claim.
","Source: TV ad from Steve Adler, Austin mayoral candidate,Mike Martinez Record on City Council, posted online Dec. 2, 2014.Martinez also chairs theeight-person boardoverseeing Capital Metro, which provides local bus and limited rail service. So he could have voted on fares charged the elderly.To our inquiries, Adlers campaign didnt provide comprehensive backup for his ad claim. But by email, spokesman Jim Wick pointed out a September 2010Austin American-Statesmannews storystating the Cap Metro board voted to require bus riders 65 and older to pay 50 cents a ride or $15 for a 31-day bus pass, starting in 2011. The story also said the board was deciding to charge seniors and people with disabilities to ride buses for the first time since 1989.According tominutes of the Nov. 10, 2010, board meeting, the six members who were there unanimously approved a resolution authorizing higher fares in part, the resolution said, to generate additional operating revenues while striving to meet growing demand for transportation options. Martinez and another board member were recorded as absent.Pares told us theboard in September 2013approved another increase in senior fares, to 60 cents, effective in 2015. Generally, she said, senior citizens receive 50 percent off regular fares.In a 2010 report, the staff of the Sunset Advisory Commission recommended the authority charge a bus fare of 50 cents for groups currently riding free. The commission had said 30 percent of Capital Metros passengers were riding for free and, it noted, the board had rejected proposed fares in 2008 and 2009. In its finalJuly 2011 reporton Capital Metro, the commission said: While fare increases are difficult, requiring only a portion of its ridership to bear the burden of these increases is not equitable or sustainable, especially in bad financial times.Martinez pointed out the sunset review occurred in keeping withlegislation passed into lawby the 2009 Legislature, which wanted Capital Metro to get its finances in order.On taxes, Wick of Adlers camp offered as backup news stories indicating thatin 2009, Martinez said taxpayers would have to pay a little more in taxes and fees through 2010 to maintain services andin 2010, the council acting to raise the citys property tax rate from 42.09 cents per $100 of property value to 45.71 cents; the city tax on a median value home was expected to increase $52 to $843.Wick followed up by emailing us achart made by Adlers campaignindicating city property taxes on a median-valued home going up on Martinezs watch. For a non-campaign analysis, we turned to the Travis Central Appraisal District; the chief appraiser, Marya Crigler, emailed us achartindicating city property taxes on a median-value homestead in 2007 were $715; in 2014, the comparable figure was $1,014. We converted the 2007 figure to 2014 dollars, using afederal inflation calculator. Upshot: Adjusted for inflation, city taxes on a median-value Austin homestead went up $278, or 34 percent, from 2007 through 2014, Martinezs council years.In 2011,we found Mostly Truea claim that Austin Energy, the city electric utility, was considering its first hike in rates since 1994. The base electric rate, covering staff, the electric system, power plants, vehicles and the like, hadnt changed since 1994. Meantime, residential customers were paying less for electricity than they once had, taking inflation into account.On June 7, 2012, the council unanimously voted to raise the base rate, theAmerican-Statesmanreported. The news story said: The complicated new rate structure will hit customers in different ways; generally speaking, the larger and more energy-hungry the home, the higher the percentage increase, effective October 2012. A typical home, which uses an average of 1,000 kilowatt-hours a month over the course of a year, will see its monthly bill rise by $8, to $113, according to Austin Energy calculations. A home that uses a lot of electricity would see its monthly bill increase by $59, to $332, the story said.Click here formoreon the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check."
"The claim that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) imposes a 3.8% ""sales tax"" on all home sales is **false**. 

The ACA does introduce a 3.8% Medicare tax on **investment income**, but this tax only applies to high-income earners exceeding specific thresholds. 

Here's the breakdown:

* **The Tax Threshold:** The tax applies to individuals with an income above $200,000 and couples with a joint income of more than $250,000. This excludes about 97% of all US households.
* **Investment Income:**  The tax is on investment income, which includes profits from real estate sales, but only for profits exceeding the capital gains threshold.
* **Capital Gains Threshold:** For individuals, the capital gains threshold is $250,000 and $500,000 for couples. Any profit above this threshold is considered investment income and subject to the 3.8% tax.
* **Not a Sales Tax:** The tax is not a universal sales tax on all real estate transactions. It only applies to high-income earners who make a substantial profit from selling their home above the capital gains threshold.

**Therefore, while the ACA does include a 3.8% Medicare tax on investment income that can include profits from home sales, it is not a sales tax on all real estate transactions and does not apply to the majority of homeowners.** 
","Origins:  One of the provisions in the reconciliation bill (HR 4872) passed in conjunction with the Patient Protection Affordable Care Act (PPACA) health care legislation calls for high-income households to be subject to a new 3.8% Medicare tax on investment income starting in 2013:First of all, the Medicare tax will be imposed only on individuals with an income above $200,000 and couples with a joint income more than $250,000, a figure which currently excludes about 97% of all U.S. households.  Second, the tax will not be assessed on every house sale, but only on real estate transactions that produce profits over a specified dollar amount.  As Sara Orrange, Government affairs director of the Spokane Association of Realtors noted in response to a repetition of the ""sales tax"" rumor in the Spokane Spokesman-Review:For example, let's assume that a couple with an income of $325,000 bought a house in 2004 for $300,000 and resold it in 2013 for $850,000, thus producing a $550,000 profit.  Since U.S. law allows a couple to exclude from their gross incomeprofits of up to $500,000 from the sale of their principal residence, the taxable gain from this sale would be $50,000 (i.e., a $550,000 profit minus the $500,000 exclusion), and the couple's taxable income would now be $375,000 (i.e., the original $325,000 plus the $50,000 of taxable profit from their home sale).   The 3.8% Medicare tax would now apply to whichever of the following dollar figures is the lesser:The referenced tax is therefore not a tax on all real estate sales; it is an investment income tax which could result in a very small percentage of home sellers paying additional taxes on home sales profits over a designated threshold amount.   In short, if you're a ""high earner"" and you sell your home at a substantial profit, you might be required to pay an additional 3.8% tax. However, given that only about 3% of U.S. households have incomes that exceed the specified income threshold amount, the existing home sale capital gains exclusion on a principal residence ($250,000 for individuals, $500,000 for couples) still stands, and the national median existing-home price in January 2012 was only $154,700 , the Medicare tax will likely affect only a very small percentage of home sellers when it is implemented in 2013.

"The claim that a viral photo shows the last queen of Mongolia, Genepil, moments before her execution in 1938 is **false**. 

While historical records indicate Genepil was indeed executed in 1938, the viral photo is actually a screenshot from a 2000 Mongolian film titled ""  ,""  which roughly translates to ""The Last Queen of the King"". This film depicts the story of Genepil, the last queen of the 8th Jebtsundamba, and features a scene at the 1:55:24 mark that closely resembles the viral photo. 

This finding was corroborated by several sources, including a synopsis on mongol-kino.mn, which describes the film as a ""historical tragedy"" about Genepil. Additionally, a tweet referencing a movie titled ""  "" provided a crucial clue that led to the discovery of the film on Facebook and confirmation of the photo's origin. 

Therefore, the viral photo is not an authentic historical image but a scene from a fictionalized depiction of Genepil's life.

"The claim states that the law firm President Trump used to show he has no ties to Russia was named ""Russia Law Firm of the Year"" for its extensive connections to Russia. The justification explains that the firm in question is Morgan Lewis, which was indeed named ""Russia Law Firm of the Year"" in 2016 due to its significant work in Russia's energy, finance, and technology sectors. The firm boasts about its deep familiarity with Russian legislation, practices, and key players, demonstrating its extensive ties to Russia.  

However, while the firm has extensive ties to Russia, the justification also clarifies that Trump's tax attorney, Sheri Dillon, has never been to Russia and does no work there. This means that Trump's use of the firm does not automatically translate to him having the same connections to Russia as the firm. Therefore, while the statement is mostly true in terms of the firm's ties to Russia, it's not entirely accurate to claim that Trump shares those ties.

"The claim that Fukushima radiation causes a 100% infant mortality rate among orca whales is **false**. While the Fukushima disaster did have a significant impact on marine life, there is **no proven link** between the radiation leak and a 100% mortality rate among orca calves. 

The justification highlights several key points:

* **Misleading sources:** Articles claiming a 100% mortality rate rely on unreliable websites like Natural News, which misrepresent information and cite sources that don't support their claims.
* **Out-of-context quotes:** Quotes from Ken Balcomb, a whale researcher, are taken out of context to bolster the claim. While he noted a decline in orca births in Puget Sound, he specifically attributed this to **food scarcity**, not Fukushima radiation.
* **No scientific evidence:**  Neither the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society nor the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration list nuclear radiation as a primary threat to whale populations.
* **Puget Sound orcas:** The decline in orca births in Puget Sound is a local phenomenon and does not reflect a global trend. The population has since rebounded, with several successful births in 2015.

The justification emphasizes that while the Fukushima disaster is a serious environmental concern, there is no credible evidence to support the claim of a 100% infant mortality rate among orca whales caused by radiation. 
","Fear-mongering articles reporting that radiation from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster (triggered by the tsunami that followed the Thoku earthquake of 11 March 2011) had caused a 100% infant mortality among orca whales born since then have been circulated online for several years. The web site Humans Are Free renewed interest in that rumor in September 2016 when they published an article with the clickbait title ""Radiation from Fukushima Now Causes 100% Infant Mortality Rate in West Coast Orcas"":Natural News listed several sources about whale deaths at the bottom of their article, but none of those sources mentioned radiation from Fukushima as likely or definitive cause.While Balcom did say that ""we haven't had any survivals in babies for a couple of years,"" he was talking about the local Puget Sound orca whale population only, and he didn't in any way connect a 100% infant orca mortality rate to radiation from Fukushima. His quotes originated with a story published by the Seattle Times in December 2014 about a baby orca whale that had died in the Pugent Sound, and while the exact cause of that whale's death was unclear, Balcolm suggested that the whale likely died due to a diminished food supply (and not radiation):Although apparently no baby orcas survived long after birth in Puget Sound in 2013 or 2014, that wasn't the case in the immediately following years, as 2015 saw nine successful orca births in Puget Sound:While radiation from the Fukushima disaster did have a major impact on marine life, the leak of radiactive material from the plant leak did not cause a proven ""100% infant mortality"" rate among orca whales. Moreover, the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration do not list nuclear radiation (from any source) among the threats currently facing the world's whale population.

"The statement that Paul Ryan voted for two wars, the Bush tax cuts, and the prescription drug bill, all of which were not paid for, is **Mostly True**.

**Supporting Evidence:**

* **Wars:** Obama's claim that Ryan voted for two wars, the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, which were not paid for is accurate.  The costs of these wars, exceeding $1 trillion for Iraq alone, were not fully offset by spending cuts or tax increases. 
* **Bush Tax Cuts:** Similarly, the Bush tax cuts, enacted in 2001 and 2003, were not fully offset by spending cuts. While Ryan argued that these cuts stimulated economic growth and increased tax revenue, they did contribute to the national deficit.
* **Prescription Drug Bill:** Obama correctly pointed out that the Medicare prescription drug benefit, enacted in 2003, was not offset by new revenue or other spending cuts. This bill did add to the federal deficit.
* **Health Care Bill:**  However, Obama's claim that the cost of the Medicare prescription drug bill was the same as his health care bill is inaccurate. While both bills were costly, the health care bill, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, was significantly more expensive.

**Conclusion:**

While Obama's assertion about the equal cost of the two bills was incorrect, his claim that Ryan voted for significant spending programs without offsetting measures is supported by evidence. Therefore, the claim is **Mostly True**. 
","In closed-doorremarks to campaignsupporterson April 14, 2011, President Barack Obama looked back in frustration at lengthy negotiations with Republicans over funding to keep the federal government operating.Obama opined, as aCBS News onlinestoryreported, that he expects Republicans to continue using the budget process to enact their political agenda under the guise of cutting spending.The president singled out U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., the House Budget Committee chairman who has authored a long-term deficit-reduction plan.When Paul Ryan says his priority is to make sure, you know, he's just being America's accountant, trying to be responsible ...This is the same guy who voted for two wars that were unpaid for, voted for the Bush tax cuts that were unpaid for, voted for the prescription drug bill that cost as much as my health care bill -- but wasn't paid for, Obama told his supporters. So it's not on the level.In making the remark, Obama pointed to several big-ticket items approved during the Bush administration while Ryan was in Congress -- ones he says have helped drive the nations record deficits.Given the prominence of the protagonists and the timeliness of the comments, we decided to take a look at Obamas critique of Ryan.With the words, Obama is offering an opinion about how Ryan has framed his budget-cutting efforts. We cant fact-check the presidents opinion about Ryans message. But we can focus on the factual assertions, and try to put them into some context.We started with the White House, which declined to comment, saying the presidents remarks spoke for themselves.Lets look at the votes.There is no dispute Ryan voted forAfghanistanandIraqwarfunding; for themajor taxcutsenacted under President George W. Bush in 2001 and2003(andextended in 2010); and for the new Medicare prescription drug benefitcreated in 2003.All were big-ticket items.But Obama goes a step further to assert that all were unpaid for. Thats Washington parlance for bills not offset by corresponding spending cuts or tax increases elsewhere in the federal budget.Budget experts we consulted and the historical record confirm there were no direct offsets built into those bills.Obamas claim on the prescription drug bill was slightly different -- that it wasnt paid for and cost as much as my health care bill.Lets break this into two parts.Obama appears to refer to the gross outlays needed for the two landmark bills.For the Medicare prescription drug bill, passed in 2003 and effective in 2006, we found a range of cost estimates for 10 years: $395 billion to $720 billion. Theofficial Congressional Budget Officeestimatewas the low end.That was at the time. Now, government estimates show the original cost projections were too high, perhaps by as much as 40 percent, said Jon Gabel, senior fellow in health care research at the National Opinion Research Center.Obamas health reform bill -- thePatient Protection and Affordable Care Act-- was pricier, with estimates in the$800 billion to $1.4 trillion range.  Ryan and Republicans opposed the bill.But the two measures were passed seven years apart, so inflation may be a factor.Paul Van de Water, a former Congressional Budget Office official who is now a senior fellow with the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, did an inflation-adjusted comparison and found the Medicare bill is probably two-thirds or three-quarters the cost of the Obama health care measure.That is, Obamas health care bill is still hundreds of millions of dollars more costly than the Medicare drug bill.So the president was off in equating the gross cost of the bills.On the offset question, the Medicare prescription drug bill, however, indisputably added to the federal deficit. It was not offset by new revenue or other spending cuts.In contrast, theofficial governmentestimateof the 2010 health care laws impact said it would actually reduce the deficit, in part because of the new taxes it enacts to help offset the cost of expanding health coverage.The source for that is the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.TheCBOs estimate is hardly undisputed-- Ryan, other Republican leaders and various budget analysts haveargued that the CBOs report was skewed by questionableassumptionsgiven to it by the Obama administration. They contend the law would actually add to the deficit.Nevertheless, we -- and Congress -- have used CBO estimates as the gold standard on such matters. So Obama has a pretty firm leg to stand on in saying his health bill was paid for while the Medicare bill was not.That covers the details behind the presidents remarks. In this case, its important to put them into their proper context. We consulted several experts and sought Ryans take.Ryan was asked in arecentinterviewabout Obamas citing the Medicare drug program, the two wars and the Bush tax cuts as major drivers of the deficit.He disagreed: We still had these enormous, building, unfunded liabilities, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security -- I mean, the big drivers of our debt.His office sent us a defense of his votes on war funding, quotinghis budget plan: Like all categories of government spending, defense spending should be executed with greater efficiency and accountability. But responsible budgeting must never lose sight of the fact that the first responsibility of the federal government is to provide for the defense of the nation.On the Bush tax cuts, Ryan aides said the congressman believes that we have deficits because Washington spends too much, not because Americans are taxed too little. He says the tax cuts helped fuel economic growth and bring in more tax revenue.Indeed, in December, Obama himself backeda compromise with Republicans, including Ryan,that extended the Bush tax cuts.Bottom line: Ryan has voted for massive new spending and so has the president, said Tad DeHaven, a budget analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute.Iraq war costs have topped $1 trillion, said Scott Lilly, former staff director for the House Appropriations Committee and now a research fellow at the left-leaning Center for American Progress. Neither Bushs war effort in Afghanistan nor Obamas escalation there has been paid for, both analysts noted.In April, bothObamaandRyanunveiled long-term deficit reduction plans in the neighborhood of $4 trillion over a decade or more.So where does this leave us?The president cherry-picked a handful of votes in an effort to show that Ryan is not pristine on the subject of the deficit.Obama got it right on Ryans support for the big-ticket bills, including war funding, Medicare prescription drugs and the Bush tax cuts. He was also on target in saying that none was offset or paid for by spending cuts or tax increases. Thats the main part of his claim.He was off the mark in asserting that one of the bills -- Medicare prescription drugs -- was as costly as his 2010 health care reform bill.That puts him at Mostly True."
"President Trump's claim that ""we're getting into the pool of the 100 million people that are not working"" is **Mostly True**. While the overall number of people not in the labor force has been steadily increasing due to demographic trends like the aging population, statistics focusing on working-age Americans (25-54 years old) support Trump's statement. 

Here's why:

* **Employment-to-Population Ratio:** This ratio, which measures the percentage of working-age Americans employed, increased by 0.6% in Trump's first 10 months, outperforming the 0.5% increase during Obama's last year. This indicates a larger percentage of working-age Americans are employed under Trump.
* **U-6 Unemployment Rate:** This broader unemployment measure includes part-time workers who prefer full-time jobs and those who haven't looked for work in the past four weeks.  It fell by 1.5 percentage points under Trump, a significantly faster decline than the 0.5% drop in Obama's final year. This suggests that more people are finding jobs or moving from part-time to full-time work under Trump.

Although these positive trends existed under Obama, the rate of improvement is greater under Trump, lending credence to his claim. However, it's essential to acknowledge that numerous factors influence the economy, and attributing all the credit to one president is an oversimplification. 
","Unemployment is at a 17-year low,he saidon Dec. 6, 2017. Very shortly it's going to be at a 19-year low. We think the numbers are going to continue to go down. And we're also getting into the pool of the 100 million people that are not working. That pool is now coming back. As you know, that's not considered in the low employment numbers, which means we have a lot of people that want to get to work, and that will be working."
"The statement that 80% of poor people did not vote in the 2014 election is **mostly true**. While data from the Census Bureau suggests a slightly lower turnout rate of around 68.5% for those earning less than $30,000, there are several factors that support Sanders' claim:

* **Financial insecurity:** A 2015 Pew Center survey found that only 20% of the least financially secure were likely voters in 2014, compared to 69% of the most financially secure. This aligns closely with Sanders' statement.
* **Underreporting:** Census data relies on self-reporting, which may overstate voter turnout rates. It's possible that Sanders' figure is closer to the actual rates.
* **Registration barriers:** Low-income individuals face significant barriers to voter registration, including cost-prohibitive voter ID laws and limited access to ID-issuing offices. This makes it harder for them to participate in elections.
* **Other obstacles:** The poor often face challenges like inflexible jobs, limited transportation options, and lack of knowledge about the political process, making it difficult for them to vote.

While Sanders' figure may be slightly exaggerated, the evidence strongly suggests that voter turnout among the poor is significantly lower than other income groups, and this can be attributed to systemic barriers and challenges they face. 
","Well, because poor people dont vote. I mean, thats just a fact,Sanders said. Thats a sad reality of American society. And thats why we have to transform one, as you know, one of thelowest voter turnouts of any major society of Earth. We have done a good job of bringing young people. But in America today, the last election in 2014, 80 percent of poor people did not vote.Sanders policy director Warren Gunnels pointed us to areportby the left-leaning policy and advocacy group Demos, which useddatafrom the Census Bureau.However, theres one catch to this figure. While an annual income of less than $10,000 is undoubtedly poor, thepoverty threshold in 2014also includes family incomes above $10,000.Sean McElwee, a policy analyst with Demos who authored the report, told us to look at annual incomes under $30,000 instead. The turnout rate for that group was31.5 percent, which means 68.5 percent of poor people didnt vote in 2014, about 10 percentage points less than what Sanders said.As PolitiFact hasreported, census data may overstate the turnout rates, as its based on self-reporting. So its possible that Sanders 80 percent figure is closer to actual rates than what the survey shows, but this is speculative.A 2015 Pew Centersurveylooked at the politics of financial security, which analysts defined as having a credit card, a savings or checking account, and a retirement or investment plan; not needing to borrow money; not falling behind on bills, rent or mortgage payments; and not receiving food assistance or Medicaid benefits.Turnout always drops in midterm elections, when the White House isnt at stake, and overall turnout in 2014 was the worst it had been in72 years. Nonetheless, census data shows turnout is consistently lower among the poor than other income groups:Voter ID laws, for example, impose costs that people struggling to make ends meet cant really afford. The Government Accountability Officereportedin 2014 that a drivers license can cost between $5 to $58.50 in states with voter ID laws. And nearly 500,000 eligible voters dont have convenient access to an ID-issuing office, according to a2012 studyby New York University.The poor also make up 55 percent of people who cant vote (which include felons and immigrants as well as residents of Washington D.C., and U.S. territories), according to a 2013 Harvard Universityworking paper.The Pew study found that just 26 percent of the least financially secure knew which party controlled Congress compared to 62 percent of the most affluent. Similarly, compared to affluent non-voters, low-income non-voters were more likely to list disinterest, forgetting to vote, health and issues of access as reasons why they didnt vote, according tocensus data."

"The statement that education spending is the biggest item in the Texas state budget, accounting for about 52% of all state dollars, is **Mostly True**. This is based on the 2018-19 state budget, which allocates $55.9 billion in general revenue towards public and higher education, representing 52.4% of the total general revenue. 

However, it's important to note that this figure only accounts for state general revenue and excludes federal aid. When considering all funding sources, including federal aid, the share of education spending drops to 37% of the total state budget. Additionally, the 52% figure for 2018-19 represents a historical low in terms of the proportion of state general revenue allocated to education in the past 20 years. This point is crucial for understanding the context of Patrick's statement and its potential implications.  
","Patrick, in a June 2017commentary, extolled the state budget then about to besigned into law by Gov. Greg Abbott, specifying: Texas spends $60 billion on schools in our two-year budget, including both federal and state funds. Of that, $41 billion is state funding. That is on top of the estimated $28 billion to $30 billion annually paid by local property taxpayers.Up front, Patrick spokesman Alejandro Garcia responded by email to our inquiry about the basis of Patricks 52 percent by pointing out a chart in the2018-19 state budget, which takes effect Sept. 1, 2017.

While Dr. Fauci didn't explicitly predict a deadly pandemic like COVID-19, he did state with certainty that a ""surprise outbreak"" of infectious disease would occur during Trump's presidency. This assertion was based on the historical pattern of previous administrations facing similar challenges, including the H1N1 pandemic, the Zika virus epidemic, and the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.

"The claim states that the majority of cruise ships are registered under foreign flags. The justification provides evidence from various sources, including:

* **Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA):** confirms that 90% of commercial vessels calling on U.S. ports fly foreign flags.
* **Academic paper by Caitlin E. Burke:**  observes that ship reflagging has historically been used to avoid U.S. taxes, labor and safety laws, environmental laws, lawsuits, and other regulations.
* **Other sources:**  mention specific cruise lines like Disney, Celebrity, and Carnival registering their ships in the Bahamas, Malta, and Panama respectively.

As the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic of March 2020 threatened to shut down businesses across America for an extended period of time, the U.S. government faced the difficult task of deciding which industries should be provided economic assistance to keep them afloat for the duration. Public sentiment in some quarters was strongly against government bailouts for businesses such as airlines and cruise companies, on the grounds that over the last several years many of the major operators had spent billions of dollars in profits buying up their own stock rather than paying down their debts. In USA Today, John M. Griffin and James M. Griffin wrote:That nearly every major cruise line registers their ships somewhere outside the U.S. is hardly a disputable point. As a 2011 news report noted, only a single major cruise ship at the time was U.S.-flagged:The three cruise lines called out by name in the meme -- Disney, Celebrity, and Carnival -- do indeed engage in this practice. It's not difficult to verify that Disney cruise ships are registered in the Bahamas, Celebrity ships in Malta, and Carnival ships in Panama.

"The label ""True"" is accurate because the provided justification details a real event in 2005.  While the initial claim was that the funding for public broadcasting would be completely eliminated, the House Appropriations Committee did vote to significantly reduce the federal funding, proposing a $100 million cut. This cut, which represented 25% of the federal funding for that year, was intended to be the first step towards eliminating all federal funding within two years. Although the House of Representatives ultimately voted to rescind the proposed $100 million cut, the justification notes that other areas of public broadcasting funding still faced cuts.

A second post from 2016 has been shared more than 82,000 times with a different photograph:There was no such child: the whole thing was a leg-pull, said Dell Children's Medical Center of Central Texas:As demonstrated so aptly by public efforts to provide relief to earthquake victims in Haiti, beneficences initiated by cell phone generally involve a tracking and billing mechanism that requires participants to text a specific short word or phrase to a particular (five-digit) number, not the willy-nilly forwarding of a explanatory narrative to as many people as possible.In 2009 we began to note that ""Forward this message to help fund medical care for a sick or dying child"" appeals were beginning to appear as cell phone text messages as well as being passed in e-mail. That trend continues into the present, with the ""shot 14-year-old boy"" just another iteration of the same basic hoax that falsely claims the American Cancer Society, the Make-A-Wish Foundation, or some other large entity will donate a predetermined amount of money every time a particular message is forwarded. Such leg-pulls have been circulating via e-mail since 1997.Typically, a large charity is named as the benefactor standing ready to direct monies towards the costs of medical care for the languishing child, but various corporations have also been fingered for this role in other iterations of the hoax, such as AOL and ZDNet in the Rachel Arlington leg pull (brain cancer sufferer in need of an operation) and McDonald's and Pizza Hut in the Justin Mallory prank (epileptic in need of long-term care)."
"The video in question, which went viral on TikTok, supposedly shows a handcuffed man saving a choking police officer's life.  However, there are numerous reasons to believe the video is likely staged rather than genuine. 

Firstly, the video originated on TikTok, not from a police department, news source, or other official channel. This raises immediate suspicion, as genuine dashcam footage typically surfaces through official channels. 

Secondly, the video is part of a three-part series, each focusing on different stages of a fictional scenario. This narrative structure, with its clear beginnings, middle, and end, suggests a scripted performance rather than a real-life event. 

Thirdly, the video's content itself presents inconsistencies.  The officer's ""costume,"" including the lack of a weapon and seemingly flimsy bulletproof vest, raises questions about the video's authenticity. 

Finally, the video's creator, @kd_k97, has not confirmed its authenticity, but has acknowledged the intended message of the video, which focuses on morality and viewer perspective. 

Given these points, it's more likely that the video is a staged ""morality play"" designed to provoke viewers to consider their own actions in a similar situation. 
","This is also just one part of a three-part video series. Part one showed the initial confrontation, involving a Black man being stopped and handcuffed after reports of ""suspicious activity."" Part two shows the handcuffed man saving the cop's life after he starts to choke. Part three shows the Black man retrieving the cuffs after saving the cop's life, giving them back to the police officer and preparing to be arrested again, before the cop decides to reward his good deed and let him go."
"The claim that Austin is burdened by the fastest-growing tax increases of any major city in the nation is **False**. While Austin has seen a significant increase in property taxes, specifically a 26% increase between 2005 and 2013, it does not rank first among major US cities. Data from the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy shows that Austin's increase ranks third among the 15 largest cities, falling behind San Jose and Philadelphia. 

Furthermore, the claim was made by an activist who did not provide supporting evidence. The city of Austin does not track taxes in other jurisdictions, and the data available suggests that other cities have experienced higher rates of property tax increases.  

Therefore, the claim that Austin has the fastest-growing tax increases among major US cities is not accurate and is rated False.

"The claim that Marlboro is distributing free cartons of cigarettes on Facebook is **false**. The justification provides several reasons why this is unlikely and points to the giveaway being a scam:

* **Suspicious Links:** The URLs in the posts linking to the supposed giveaway are not credible and are not associated with Marlboro or its parent company, Altria.
* **Fake Website:** The landing page claiming to offer free cigarettes is a fake website mimicking Facebook's design but hosted on a different domain.
* **No Official Marlboro Presence:** Marlboro doesn't appear to have any official social media accounts, and its website is only accessible to registered users.
* **Strict Tobacco Advertising Laws:** Tobacco advertising is heavily regulated, including a ban on free samples. It's highly improbable for Marlboro to engage in such a promotion on social media.
* **Common Scam Tactic:** This giveaway scheme follows a common pattern used by scammers who target users with promises of free items, then use the opportunity to gather personal information or harvest likes. 

The justification also cites a Better Business Bureau article that explains common ways scammers utilize legitimate brands to trick people. 
","By now, most social media users are familiar with survey scams; Kohl's, Costco, Home Depot, Lowe's, Kroger, Best Buy, Macy's, Olive Garden, Publix, Target, and Walmart are among retailers used as bait by scammers (seeking personal information and valuable page likes from Facebook users). A July 2014 article from the Better Business Bureau illustrated how folks might spot and avoid bad actors utilizing the reputations of brands on social media:While Marlboro occasionally sends coupons to registered customers, tobacco advertising and promotion is heavily restricted (including a prohibition on free samples) and is highly unlikely to ever occur on social media in the manner posited above."
"The claim ""Do Falling Coconuts Kill More People Than Sharks Each Year?"" is labeled as **NEI** (Not Enough Information). 

The provided justification demonstrates that while shark attack fatality rates are readily available through the International Shark Attack File, reliable data on coconut-related deaths is lacking.  

The most frequently cited figure of 150 annual deaths from falling coconuts originates from a press release by a British travel insurance company, Club Direct, which itself references a 1984 study on falling coconut injuries in Papua New Guinea. However, this study, while highlighting the potential danger of falling coconuts, doesn't provide a global estimate of fatalities. 

Additionally, despite anecdotal reports and newspaper articles citing coconut-related deaths, there is no published, systematic research establishing a global annual death rate from falling coconuts. This makes it impossible to definitively prove or disprove the claim. 

Therefore, due to the absence of reliable data on coconut-related deaths, the claim remains **unproven**, making it impossible to determine whether falling coconuts kill more people than sharks each year. 
","A popular trope used by those seeking to recast the shark as a misunderstood beast is to compare the risk sharks pose to humans to the purported risk posed by ripening coconuts. These sweet-tasting, nutrient-rich tree nuts  the logic goes  kill more people by falling out of trees than do sharks. This is an ostensibly simple question to investigate, as it requires knowing only two things: the annual death rate from unprovoked shark attacks and the annual death rate from falling coconuts.The annual death rate from sharks is pretty straightforward. The University of Florida runs a comprehensive database of shark attacks and fatalities: The International Shark Attack File. According to their research, there has been an average of six deaths annually over the past decade.Problems emerge, however, when one tries to get a handle on how many people die each year as a direct result of injuries sustained by falling coconuts. The most commonly cited figure is that 150 people die each year from falling coconuts. No published research, however, has come up with any reliable estimate of this statistic whatsoever. Perhaps ironically, it appears that this number, as well, gained a sense of legitimacy from the University of Florida's International Shark Attack File, when a researcher there quoted the statistic in a press release for a local event:Investigating the specific claim of 150 coconut deaths each year, syndicated skeptic column The Straight Dope reached out to Burgess in 2002 to ask what his source was for that statistic, and discovered that, ultimately, it came from a British travel-insurance firm named Club Direct:According to the column, this press release also cited a 1984 study from the Journal of Trauma titled ""Injuries Due to Falling Coconuts"". That study  the recipient of a 2001 Ig Nobel award for research that ""cannot or should not be replicated""  did not set out to calculate the global annual death rate from falling coconuts, however. Instead, using simple physics and four years of data collected from a remote Papua New Guinean hospital, it sought to demonstrate that the risk to human health from falling coconuts was a real one. From a physics standpoint, the paper argued: Honolulu Star-Bulletin. 28 July 1973. Credit: Newspapers.com The Honolulu Advertiser. 14 January 1997. Credit: Newspapers.com"
"The claim that the term ""Bar"" in ""Bar Exam"" implies a covert collusion among lawyers is **false**. The justification thoroughly debunks this conspiracy theory by explaining the historical origins of the word ""bar"" in the legal context. It demonstrates that ""bar"" refers to the physical barrier separating lawyers from the public in courtrooms and is rooted in the concept of ""being called to the bar,"" which signifies a lawyer's right to practice law. This explanation highlights the theory's reliance on fabricated acronyms, inaccurate historical claims, and misinterpretations of word origins, ultimately revealing it as unfounded. 
","Here's how the elaborate and confusing theory is outlined in an anonymously-authored essay called ""Hiding Behind the Bar,"" which has been republished and shared in tax protester and sovereign citizen circles for more than a decade:Almost every part of this is factually inaccurate. For one thing, the International Bar Association was founded in 1947, not in the 1600s. Second, we could find no evidence of the existence of a professional association for lawyers called the ""British Accredited Registry,"" either in 2018 or at any previous time in history.A History of the American Bar, a 1911 book by the Pulitzer Prize-winning legal scholar Charles Warren, contains no mention of any ""British Accredited Registry"" or ""British Accreditation Registry"" (with ""accredited"" and ""accreditation"" being used variously in different versions of this conspiracy theory). It would also make little sense for a group of lawyers in 17th century England to form a group describing itself as ""British."" Great Britain (composed of England, Wales and Scotland) does not have, and has never had, a unified courts system, instead being separated into two systems: England and Wales and Scotland. In fact, Great Britain itself was not even formally created until 1707, when the Acts of Union joined the Kingdom of Scotland with the Kingdom of England (which included Wales).In the Middle Ages, lawyers in London established four ""Inns of Court"": Lincoln's Inn, the Inner Temple, the Middle Temple, and Gray's Inn. These were physical buildings but, more figuratively, they were also the professional associations for lawyers working in the more important English courts. A ""barrister"" was a legal expert or advocate who has been ""called to the bar."" This is a metonymic phrase which is rooted in the physical barrier that was present in a courtroom, to separate fully qualified lawyers entitled to plead cases before a judge from (roughly speaking) trainee lawyers and members of the public. In modern times, this physical barrier generally separates participants in a trial (such as lawyers, clerks, defendants, the jury, and the judge) from the gallery in which members of the public and the news media sit.A 1930 essay published in the Cornell Law Review (page 393) refers to a bar association's having been established in Boston in 1761, but remember that a bar association is no more than a kind of guild for lawyers. ""Bar"" is not an acronym for ""British Accredited Registry,"" because that acronym is a fabrication. As with many sovereign citizen theories, the essay builds on the shaky foundations of an inaccurate account of the history of bar associations in the United States and draws confused conclusions about the function and legal status of lawyers.That passage is false. Whatever the older origins of the word ""attorney"" might be, the modern definition of that word is much broader. Merriam-Webster defines an attorney as simply ""one who is legally appointed to transact business on another's behalf."" In common American parlance, ""attorney"" is used interchangeably with ""lawyer.""It's not clear what the origins of the the fabricated acronym are, but ""British Accredited Registry"" was invoked as early as 2001 by Austin Gary Cooper, a long-time ""sovereign citizen"" activist. In 2003, a U.S. District Court in Colorado barred Cooper and his wife Martha Cooper from selling advice on how to avoid paying federal income tax after the couple set up groups called ""Taking Back America"" and the ""Ten Foundation,"" which advised their paying customers that they could renounce their United States citizenship, call themselves ""American citizens"" instead, and escape their tax obligations. In 2006, Cooper was given a six-month prison sentence for criminal contempt after failing to comply with that court order, which obliged him to hand over the names of his customers, among other requirements. During court proceedings, Cooper accused the judge of treason and called him a ""Nazi bastard"" and a ""British Accredited Registry"" lawyer, saying: ""You people are going to destroy our country. British accredited registry bar association, you're going to destroy our country ...""In 2017, prosecutors in Tennessee charged Cooper, who is now 69 years old, with 10 counts of forgery and filing a fraudulent lien. The case was ongoing as of January 2018."
"The claim that Leonardo DiCaprio donated $10 million to Ukraine via the International Visegrad Fund is **false**. 

The justification for this label is as follows:

* **No official announcement:** Neither DiCaprio nor the International Visegrad Fund (IVF) have publicly acknowledged or announced this donation.  
* **Lack of credible sources:** The rumor originated from unreliable sources like anonymous ""sources"" in a seemingly fabricated article on guyanasouthamerica.gy. The ""Polish News"" article cited by many others was not the original source and cannot be verified.
* **Misinterpretation of information:** A tweet from Visegrad 24 stating that DiCaprio donated to Ukraine was misinterpreted as meaning the IVF received the donation, while the tweet itself did not make that claim.
* **Confirmation from IVF:** A spokesperson for the IVF explicitly denied any knowledge of a $10 million donation from DiCaprio.
* **Official statement from DiCaprio's team:** DiCaprio's representatives confirmed that while he has made private donations to humanitarian organizations working in Ukraine, the $10 million donation claim is not true. 

In summary, the rumor appears to stem from misinformation, misinterpretations, and lack of evidence, making it impossible to verify. The available information suggests that DiCaprio has supported Ukraine through private donations to humanitarian organizations, but the claim of a $10 million donation to the IVF is unfounded. 
","In March 2022, a rumor started circulating online that actor Leonardo DiCaprio had donated $10 million to Ukraine after the country was invaded by Russia. While this claim was repeated ad nauseam across social media, there's little evidence to suggest that it's true. In an article that has since been deleted, the Daily Mail reported:For starters, neither Leonardo DiCaprio nor the International Visegrad Fund (IVF) have made any announcements about this alleged donation. We searched the social media profiles and websites for both the actor and the IVF, an international donor organization that finances grants and scholarships to encourage the ""advancement of innovative ideas in Central and Eastern Europe,"" and found no mention of this alleged donation. Furthermore, this rumor can't be traced back to a reputable news source. While most articles about this alleged donation quoted a report from a website called ""Polish News,"" that March 7 article is not the primary source for this rumor. The earliest iteration of this claim that we could find was published on guyanasouthamerica.gy on March 5, 2022. That article cited anonymous ""sources"" inside Ukraine:The claim that this money was donated to the International Visegrad Fund appears to come from people making big assumptions based on little information. On March 6, a day after the anonymously sourced guyanasouthamerica.gy article was published, the Twitter account Visegrad 24 picked up on the story and published the following tweet. (Visegrad 24 previously shared a false rumor that Pornhub was blocking Russian users from accessing its site).People Magazine reported:"
"The claim that the photographs depict a boy being punished under Sharia law for stealing bread is **false**. The justification explains that the images actually show a street performer staging a stunt for money. 

Here's a breakdown of the justification:

* **Origin of the Photographs:** The photographs originated from an Iranian news site, PeykeIran, which confirmed that the images depict a common street act where the performer simulates being run over by a vehicle.
* **Nature of the Act:**  This street act involves a performer seemingly being run over by a heavy vehicle, but it is a staged stunt with no lasting harm done.
* **Purpose of the Act:** The performer, a young boy, uses facial expressions and the stunt itself to elicit sympathy and earn money from onlookers. 
* **Contradictions with Sharia Law:**  The photographs do not depict any form of amputation or involvement of religious authorities, which are integral to Sharia punishments.  Sharia law also states that punishments like amputation are not applied to children or for theft of small-value items, especially food stolen out of hunger.
* **Evidence of a Staged Stunt:** The presence of a huckster drumming up business, the blanket under the boy's arm, and the missing images that show the boy unharmed after the stunt further indicate that the scene is staged.

Therefore, the claim that the boy is being punished under Sharia law for stealing bread is unsupported and false. The photographs actually depict a street performer executing a common stunt. 
","The above-displayed photographs have been circulating on the Internet since at least 2004, usually in e-mail forwards that set them in one of several Arab/Muslim areas (e.g., Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Palestinian territories) and claim that the boy pictured is being punished under a harsh Sharia  law system that imposes a penalty grossly out of proportion to the nature of the crime (i.e., having his arm crushed under a vehicle because he stole a loaf of bread).These pictures originated with the Iranian news site PeykeIran, who (along with persons who have witnessed similar scenes in other countries) confirmed that what the photographs actually depict is performers hustling money from onlookers by staging a common street act, one in which a subject seemingly allows himself to be run over by a heavy vehicle and then emerges unscathed.  This a common act, variations of which are performed by many magicians and accomplished through a variety of means, with no lasting harm done. That the subject is a small boy who grimaces his way through the stunt is all part of the act, intended to elicit sympathy and extra cash from onlookers.  (Despite his contorted facial expressions, the boy is not seriously or permanently injured by the process.)It's difficult to make any definitive statement about Sharia/Islamic law since customs and enforcement can vary from region to region, but although the cutting off  hands may sometimes be the prescribed maximum penalty for cases of theft under the strictest interpretations of Sharia, Islamic law resources consistently note that such punishments shall not be applied to children who have not yet reached puberty (which is defined as the age of 15 for boys), nor for the theft of small-value items or food by the hungry:  "
"The claim that the giveaway scam involving a Michael Kors handbag includes undisclosed subscription charges is **true**. The justification provides evidence that the scam lures users with the promise of a Michael Kors handbag for a small fee of $7.95. However, after answering a few questions, users are redirected to a website that reveals the true nature of the scam: a hidden subscription service costing $67.32 per month. This hidden charge is not disclosed in the initial TikTok ads, making it a deceptive practice. The justification further points out the suspicious nature of the website domains and the lack of a legitimate company name associated with the contact number. This reinforces the claim that the giveaway is a scam designed to trick users into signing up for an expensive subscription service without their informed consent. 
","Users who clicked on the ads were led to a page on 20mccsd.tech, a website that showedregistration information for a domain registrar in Russia. This may have been the country from which the scam was originating.After answering three questions, users were redirected to exclusiveluckyshop.com. This website then claimed users would be eligible to enter into a supposed giveaway for a Michael Kors Voyager Medium Crossgrain Leather Tote Bag. This product normally retails for $298, according to Michael Kors' official website.In other words, this was a hidden subscription scam, a topic that we previously reported about with another scam."
"The claim that every vote used to be counted on election night is **false**. The provided evidence debunks this assertion by citing numerous examples from past elections where vote counting extended beyond Election Day, even in recent years. 

The justification highlights reports from reputable sources, including newspapers, The Associated Press, and PBS, demonstrating that vote counting often continues for days, even weeks, after Election Day. This is attributed to various factors like:

* **Mail-in and absentee ballots:**  The increasing prevalence of mail-in and absentee ballots necessitates additional time for processing and counting.
* **Close races:**  Close races require meticulous recounts and verifications, delaying the final outcome.
* **Different state procedures:**  States have diverse vote-counting procedures, with some starting early and others waiting until Election Day.

The justification also refutes the conspiracy theory that delays in vote counting are a result of widespread voter fraud. No credible evidence of large-scale fraud has been found by researchers. 

In conclusion, the provided evidence convincingly demonstrates that the claim of every vote being counted on election night in the past is inaccurate. The claim is refuted by historical data and expert opinions, highlighting the complexity of election processes and the ongoing nature of vote counting in many instances. 
","On Nov. 7, The Associated Press reported that ""no state releases complete and final results on election night"" and that they haven't done so in modern history, according to experts.The tweet appeared to be pushing the notion that it now takes much longer to count the votes on and after Election Day to bolster the broader (and false) conspiracy theory, pushed by former U.S. President Donald Trump and others, alleging there has been widespread voter fraud in U.S. elections in recent years. The implication appears to be that the ""delay"" is caused by some sort of tampering on a massive scale in the days after an election. But researchers have never found any credible evidence of large-scale voting fraud in American elections.Also, we want to note off the top that some states begin counting mail-in and absentee ballots early, whereas others wait to start tabulating votes until Election Day. Readers can find data on these states and their vote-counting procedures on thewebsitefor the National Conference of State Legislatures.On Nov. 1, 2020, The Arizona Republic newspaperreported of that year's U.S. presidential election, ""Actual vote counts take weeks to tabulate."" The reporting also noted that, ""It's possible we won't know the winners of major races for more than a week.""According to newspaper archives on Newspapers.com, votes were still being counted after Election Day in California,Delaware, andFlorida, to name just the first three examples we found.On Nov. 6, 2018, KQED.org reported of Election Day, ""For close races  for example, some of the hotly contested congressional contests  the final results may not be known for days, or possibly even weeks."" The story added, ""What will be needed tonight is generally in short supply these days: patience.""We were able to quickly find newspaper articles published after election night that said votes for the midterms were still in the process of being counted inNew Jersey, Florida, andCalifornia, and again, those were simply the first three examples we encountered in search results.On Nov. 7, 2016, Utah's Deseret News newspaperpublished a story with the headline, ""Here's why precinct results don't tell the whole story on election night."" The reporting said, ""Don't be shocked if you don't know whether or not your county voted for a certain candidate. The majority of Utah's votes are now mail-in votes, which delay the count.""After Election Day, votes were still being counted days later in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Arizona, and other states.On Nov. 5, 2014, the Burlington Free Press newspaperreported that Vermont's Democratic and Republican gubernatorial candidates in the 2014 election had chosen to wait until the morning after election night to make statements, so that all votes would have a chance to be counted.Further, we quickly found examples that showed votes were still being counted after Election Day in Illinois, California, Alaska, Virginia, Louisiana, and other states.On Oct. 30, 2012, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser newspaperreported via USA Today that U.S. President Barack Obama and Republican rival Mitt Romney were ""prepared to take their presidential campaign to the courts,"" in the case that ""election night doesn't produce a clear winner."" Election Day was on Nov. 6 in 2012. The story documented how some states might take days to count all of the votes.""In Ohio, for example, provisional and absentee ballots can be counted as late as Nov. 16,"" the reporting said.After Election Day, multiple newspapers reported thatFlorida, Montana, and Marylandwere still counting votes, and once again, those were just the first three examples we found when performing a quick and simple online search.In 2010, The New York Times reported that ballots in the state of Washington were still being counted as of Nov. 3, the day after the election. Similarly, the Naples Daily News published that votes were still being counted in Florida after Election Day. More examples were easily located on Newspapers.com, such as votes still being counted after Election Day in Minnesota, Illinois, and California, just to name a few.In 2008, a presidential election year, Election Day was on Nov. 4. On the next day, The Guardian, Politico, and many others reported that ballots were still being counted in some states. We quickly found newspaper articles that were published after the election that said it took days or even more than a week to count all of the votes in Massachusetts, Georgia, and Oregon, for example.On Nov. 9, 2006, two days after the 2006 election, the Billings Gazette newspaperreported that votes were still being counted in Montana. We also found that votes were still being counted in North Carolina as of Nov. 12, according to the Charlotte Observer.On Nov. 3, 2004, the Santa Fe New Mexican newspaper reported that votes were still being counted in a number of states for the U.S. presidential election. The same was also the case in Iowa, the Miami Herald published. These were just the two first examples we found. Election Day was on Nov. 2.In the 2002 election,the The Monitor newspaper in McAllen, Texas, reported that votes were still being counted two days after Election Day. The same was the case days later in California, North Carolina, and Arizona, just to name a few examples we found.In the 2000 election, the winner of the presidential contest was not known for more than one month. As PBS.org reported,""Afew hundred votes separated Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore in Florida,"" which led to a recount and the famous term, ""hanging chads.""The data in this story goes back more than two decades, with PBS and AP adding context for elections from the 19th century.

"The image of Carl Sagan holding a ""No Billboards in Space"" sign is **false**. The image has been circulating online since at least 2010, with a Redditor admitting to creating it for a Photoshop contest. The original image actually shows Sagan holding one of the ""Pioneer Plaques"", which were launched into space in the early 1970s as a message to potential extraterrestrial life. This means the image with the ""No Billboards in Space"" sign has been doctored, making it a fabricated image. 
","When Elon Musk launched the Falcon Heavy rocket (and its payload of a Tesla Roadster) in February 2018, many saw it as a giant step toward commercial space travel and sending a human to Mars.Others saw something slightly more cynical, namely a giant advertisement:This photograph has been circulating online since at least 2010. A Redditor claimed in a 2011 posting of the image that they had created it for a photoshop contest on the web site Fark, but we were unable to locate the original contest. The Pioneer Plaques were launched into space in the early 1970s aboard the Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 spacecrafts.

"The claim is ""Who is responsible for the escalation of the debt?"", and the justification provided in the text leads to the label ""True"" because the provided information highlights the complexity of attributing debt increases to specific presidents. The justification points out several factors that make it difficult to draw simple conclusions:

* **Different Timeframes:** The chart compares presidents with varying lengths of service, making a direct comparison of debt increases unreliable. Longer terms naturally lead to greater potential influence on debt levels.
* **Inherited Policies:** Presidents inherit existing policies and budgets, making it challenging to isolate the impact of their own actions on debt.
* **Different Debt Measures:** The article discusses the distinction between ""debt held by the public"" and ""intragovernmental debt,"" emphasizing that the latter doesn't necessarily reflect economic burden. 
* **Contextual Factors:** The justification suggests that simple percentage changes in debt may not be the best measure of economic health and that considering factors like the Debt-to-GDP ratio might provide a more complete picture.

In conclusion, the justification highlights the limitations of attributing debt increases solely to individual presidents.  It emphasizes the need for a more nuanced analysis that considers factors beyond simple percentage changes in debt. Therefore, the claim ""Who is responsible for the escalation of the debt?"" is labeled ""True"" as the provided information suggests that this is a complex issue with no straightforward answer. 
","The chart reproduced above, which was posted to the Flickr account of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, attempted to reverse conventional political stereotypes by portraying recent Republican presidents as responsible for huge increases in the national debt, while showing recent Democratic presidents as responsible for much lower increases in the level of debt.  Although this chart is labeled as presenting a ""percent increase in public debt,"" it actually uses figures corresponding to the total described as ""gross federal debt"" above (i.e., a combination of debt held by the public and debt held by government accounts, rather than just the former).  We checked the numbers in this chart by using (for pre-1993 years) the U.S. Treasury's Monthly Statement of the Public Debt (MSPD), noting the total debt reported as of January 31 of each relevant year, and (for 1993 onwards) the Treasury's The Debt to the Penny and Who Holds It application, noting the total debt reported as of Inauguration Day of each relevant year. Which is the best measure of debt for this purpose: public debt, intragovernmental debt, or a combination of the two?  As noted in the General Accounting Office's FAQ on Federal Debt, they represent rather different concepts: Are plain percentage changes in the national debt level a useful figure, or do they need to be placed in context to have relevance?  Some would argue, for example, that the Debt-to-GDP ratio is a better measure of economic health relative to the national debt than raw debt figures alone, and a chart which tracked the change in that ratio over the last several presidencies would paint a significantly different picture of debt levels than the one displayed above."
"The label ""NEI"" (Not Enough Information) is appropriate for this claim.  While there are accounts claiming a woman named Lana had a late-term abortion because she learned she was carrying a male fetus, the evidence strongly suggests this story is fabricated. 

**Here's why:**

* **Origin and Source:** The story originates from a newly created website called ""Injustice Stories"" with no prior reputation or known history. The site itself seems designed to generate clicks and attention rather than provide credible information.
* **Lack of Verification:**  The claim was picked up by some media outlets like Daily Caller and Huffington Post without proper fact-checking,  highlighting the need for critical evaluation of information.
* **Implausibility and Inconsistencies:** The story itself contains inconsistencies and implausible elements:
    * The woman, Lana, is described as a wealthy, globe-trotting feminist with no career, which seems unlikely.
    * Her justification for the abortion, claiming she fears raising a son who would become a ""monster"" due to male influence, is extreme and lacks any real-world basis.
    * The account of the abortion itself is overly simplistic and contradicts typical experiences with late-term procedures.
* **Motive:**  The likely motive for the fabricated story is to generate outrage and clicks, potentially with an anti-feminist or anti-abortion agenda. 

**In conclusion:**  While the claim exists, the evidence overwhelmingly suggests it is a hoax designed to mislead and manipulate public opinion. Therefore, we lack enough credible information to verify the claim as true. 
","Origins:  On 17 January 2015, the website Injustice Stories published an article purportedly Unnoticed at first, the claim about ""Lana"" and her questionable decision to obtain a late-term abortion achieved traction when sites such as Daily Caller and the Huffington Post published articles about it after taking the single-source story at face value (and apparently without any attempt at verification) in early February 2015."
"The flyer titled ""Who is Derek M. Chauvin?"" contained several claims about Derek Chauvin's history with the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD). Some of these claims were accurate, while others were either false or subjective. 

**Accurate Claims:**

* **Chauvin was involved in several shootings of civilians:** This claim is accurate. Chauvin was involved in the shootings of Leroy Martinez, Ira Latrell Toles, and Wayne Reyes.
* **Chauvin was involved in a deadly car chase:** This claim is also accurate. Chauvin was involved in a car chase in 2005 that resulted in a crash and the deaths of three people. 
* **Chauvin had 17 complaints filed against him during his MPD career:** This claim is accurate. Snopes obtained Chauvin's Employee Complaint Profile Card which confirmed this information. 

**False or Outdated Claims:**

* **Chauvin's restraint technique was not part of MPD training:** This claim is demonstrably false. At the time of George Floyd's death, MPD policy allowed officers to use neck restraints as a non-deadly force option. 
* **The shooting of Leroy Martinez was an ""inappropriate"" police shooting:** This claim is subjective. While Chauvin and other officers were placed on administrative leave, the police chief at the time believed the officers acted ""appropriately and courageously"" under the circumstances.
* **Chauvin's former attorney, Tom Kelly, represented him for the entirety of the George Floyd case:** This claim is outdated. Kelly initially represented Chauvin but withdrew due to medical reasons. 

**Claims with Mixed Evidence:**

* **Chauvin's actions in the shootings of Leroy Martinez and Ira Latrell Toles were considered excessive use of force:** While both incidents resulted in injuries, it's difficult to definitively label them as excessive use of force. The circumstances surrounding both incidents are complex and interpretations of them are subjective.

Overall, the flyer contains a mix of accurate, false, and subjective claims. It's important to note that some of the claims may be accurate but outdated, reflecting changes in policy and events that transpired after the flyer's circulation.  
","Rumors are surging in the wake of George Floyd's death and resulting protests against police violence and racial injustice in the United States. Stay informed. Read our special coverage, contribute to support our mission, and submit any tips or claims you see here.George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, died in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020, after a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, pinned him to the ground and kneeled on his neck while Floyd repeatedly said, ""I can't breathe."" A bystander recorded the confrontation in a video that swiftly spread across social media as a deadly example of what many viewers dubbed racism by American cops.The footage ultimately sparked an international reckoning over racism, marked by weeks of protests that largely began peaceful during the day and then escalated to chaos at night, with many U.S. cities reporting property damage, fires, and violent clashes between law-enforcement officers and protesters.At the center of the civil rights movement were four former police officers charged in Floyd's death  particularly Chauvin, 44, whom authorities arrested and charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter. A judge ruled he would stand trial on his own, separate from the other three defendants, beginning March 8, 2021, according to The Associated Press. (No, he did not commit suicide, like some rumors online claim.) Photo by Ramsey County Sheriff's Office That's a question the jury trial will legally determine. Prosecutors have charged Chauvin with second-degree murder and manslaughter after they say he kept Floyd pinned to the ground and knelt on his neck for almost eight minutes, including for nearly three minutes after Floyd became non-responsive. As of this writing, they were scheduled to be tried together  separate from Chauvin's case  beginning Aug. 23, The Associated Press reported.Floyd was later pronounced dead at a hospital. The Hennepin County Medical Examiner's office, which encompasses Minneapolis, ruled Floyd's manner of death a homicide.It is important to note here: In the county office's preliminary autopsy report, medical investigators said Floyd's underlying health conditions, such as coronary artery disease and hypertensive heart disease, contributed to his death in similar ways as Chauvin's restraint. But an autopsy commissioned by Floyd's family had different results; it determined he did, in fact, die of asphyxiation. (Read more about those findings here.)You can read the full charges against Chauvin here; Thao here; Kueng here, and Lane here. At the time of Floyd's death, MPD's Policy & Procedure Manual (which governs everything from how officers should dress on the job to what tactics are OK to use during arrests) included the below-displayed section obtained by Snopes.  In other words, department policy permitted officers to use what it considered a ""non-deadly force option"" by kneeling on a suspect's neck if they had received lessons in how to do so without applying pressure to the suspect's airway. Officers could use ""light or moderate pressure"" to get someone under ""control"" or ""adequate pressure"" to make someone unconscious in situations they deemed appropriate.However, in the aftermath of Floyd's death, MPD agreed to ban officers from using chokeholds and neck restraints at the request of state authorities. As a result of that change, the police manual now reads:The Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association (MPPOA), which provides legal services to police by drawing from about a dozen attorneys, is providing legal representation for Chauvin.And initially, yes, the association had assigned Tom Kelly to Floyd's case. Kelly was one of the defense attorneys who represented St. Anthony, Minnesota, police officer Jeronimo Yanez, who was acquitted on all charges in connection to the fatal shooting of Philando Castile, a Black man, during a traffic stop in 2017.But on June 3, 2020, Eric Nelson of the Halberg Criminal Defense firm took over Chauvin's case, Reuters reported. Kelly told that news outlet the association had originally assigned the case to him because he was the on-call attorney at the time of Chauvin's arrest. But he gave up the case for medical-related reasons.According to news reports, on Aug. 8, 2011, Chauvin and other officers chased down Martinez, 23, in a public housing complex in South Minneapolis after they said they heard gunshots and saw Martinez running with a gun. (The Indian County-Today news outlet confirmed that Martinez is an Alaskan Native.)One of the officers shot Martinez in the torso, and as he recovered in the hospital, Martinez faced second-degree assault charges in connection with a shooting that had taken place before police arrived on the scene. Here's how The Star Tribune newspaper reported the incident:  According to that newspaper's coverage, a witness who said she watched the shooting from her balcony in the housing complex maintained to journalists that police weren't telling the full story. The witness said Martinez had thrown down his gun and was holding his hands in the air when one of the officers (not Chauvin) shot him, after warning that he would open fire.Whether the flyer is correct in describing the shooting as ""inappropriate"" is a subjective issue. The police chief at the time said he believed the officers acted ""appropriately and courageously,"" suggesting they had acted within department policy under the circumstances, The New York Times reported.This claim in the flyer is largely true. Here's what we know about that incident:While responding to a call of domestic violence at a South Minneapolis apartment in May 2008, Chauvin opened fire on a 21-year-old Black man, Ira Latrell Toles. The Associated Press reported at the time:Following Floyd's death, he told The Daily Beast that yes, the mother of his child had called police on him that night, and that he had locked himself in the bathroom with an unlit cigarette after officers broke down the apartment door. Then, Toles alleged, Chauvin busted in the bathroom door and started hitting the 21-year-old without warning.Chauvin later told investigators that, because Toles supposedly failed to comply with officers' commands, he attempted to hit the young man in the head with the butt of his handgun and then opened fire when he thought Toles reached for his gun, The Star Tribune reported. Toles ex-girlfriend reported that Chauvin fired his firearm about two seconds after he entered the bathroom after Toles.In total, the six officers fired 42 rounds in four seconds, according to the The Washington Post. Reyes (who the Canadian national news outlet, APTN News, reported was a member of the Leech Lake Ojibwe Band in Minnesota) was struck multiple times and died. However, it was unclear if Chauvin fired any of the fatal shots.In the end, a grand jury ruled the officers' actions appropriate, and Chauvin was recommended for a Medal of Valor following the shooting, according to The Star Tribune. Here's what we can confirm: Roughly four years into Chauvin's MPD career, in 2005, he and another officer used a squad car on duty to chase a car that ended up crashing into another vehicle, killing three people, according to news reports.Although MPD has not fulfilled requests for records to determine why, or under what circumstances, conduct complaints were filed against Chauvin prior to Floyd's death, this claim was somewhat true.  Snopes obtained Chauvin's Employee Complaint Profile Card, which provided few details other than a tally of 17 complaints against him throughout his MPD career.The only allegation that resulted in disciplinary action (two letters of reprimand) was filed in 2007, when Chauvin allegedly pulled over a woman for going 10 mph over the speed limit, frisked her, and put her in his squad car, according to news reports. The woman's baby and dog were reportedly inside the vehicle during the traffic stop.After graduating high school in 1994, Chauvin worked restaurant jobs as a prep cook, joined the U.S. Army, and eventually attended St. Paul's Metropolitan State University, The Star Tribune reported. There, his focus shifted to police work -- he eventually earned a degree in law enforcement -- and he joined MPD's ranks in 2001, at age 25. We also know that Chauvin and Floyd both worked at the same Minneapolis nightclub, El Nuevo Rodeo. Maya Santamaria, who owned the building that housed the club, confirmed with Snopes that both men worked at the business during periods that overlapped (Chauvin worked as an off-duty police officer), but it was unknown whether they ever ran into each other or were introduced.MPD leaders commended Chauvin's work at various points throughout his career, according to the news archives. For example, they awarded him a Medal of Commendation in 2008 after he apparently disarmed a man during one of his nightclub security shifts.In 2010, Chauvin married his wife, Kellie Chauvin. The two had met at Hennepin County Medical Center, where she worked as a radiologic technician and he brought someone one night for a health check before an arrest, she told The Pioneer Press for a story about her preparation to compete in Mrs. Minnesota America.Additionally, the couple owned and rented two homes in Woodbury, a suburb east of St. Paul, before they bought a home in Oakdale, Washington County, according to property records compiled by The Star Tribune. In 2011, they also bought a townhouse near Orlando, Florida, where voting records showed Derek Chauvin is registered to vote.Nonetheless, the couple's financial situation emerged in international news headlines in July, when authorities accused them of failing to report income from various jobs.Washington County prosecutors charged Derek and Kellie Chauvin with aiding and abetting tax evasion and tax fraud. According to the criminal complaint, they failed to report more than $460,000 in Minnesota income over five years and failed to pay almost $38,000 in taxes owed during that time frame, according news reports."
"The label ""True"" is accurate because the claim states that a photograph of a house saved from flooding by an ""inflatable dam"" was recirculated online during Hurricane Harvey. This is true because the photo, which was taken in June 2016, shows a home protected by an AquaDam, a water-filled barrier, during a severe flood. While the dam isn't inflatable in the traditional sense, it was referred to as ""inflatable"" in online posts, causing confusion about the timing of the photo. The justification provides evidence from a local news report and a video report from USA Today, confirming the authenticity of the photo and the use of the AquaDam. Therefore, the claim accurately describes the recirculation of the photo and its connection to Hurricane Harvey, making the label ""True"" justified.

"The claim states that Canadian Richard Brunt wrote an open letter about America's midterm elections. The justification provides evidence supporting this claim: 

* It states that on November 7, 2014, the Detroit Free Press published a letter from Richard Brunt, a Canadian citizen, titled ""You Americans have no idea just how good you have it with Obama.""
* The letter directly addresses the results of the midterm elections and expresses Brunt's confusion about the outcome.

Therefore, the claim is **true**.

"The claim that the largest U.S. companies would owe $620 billion in U.S. taxes on the cash they store in tax havens is **Mostly True**. While there is no definitive way to calculate the exact amount, estimates from various credible sources, including tax scholars and financial institutions, range from $300 billion to $620 billion.  

**Supporting Evidence:**

* **Sanders' claim is based on a study by Citizens for Tax Justice and US PIRG:** This study analyzed the accumulated profits held offshore by Fortune 500 companies and estimated a potential $620 billion tax liability.
* **Independent tax scholars support the general concept:** While they may not agree with the specific number, they acknowledge that U.S. multinationals hold significant unrepatriated foreign earnings and are likely paying significantly lower tax rates overseas.
* **Expert consensus leans towards a mid-range estimate:**  The mid-range estimates from credible sources are around $500 billion to $550 billion, suggesting that Sanders' claim is at the higher end of the spectrum.

**Potential Caveats:**

* **The $620 billion figure is a high estimate:**  Experts acknowledge that it is difficult to determine the exact amount, and Sanders' number might be on the upper end of the range.
* **The nature of the overseas holdings is unclear:** While Sanders refers to it as ""cash,"" some experts suggest that a portion of these earnings might be invested in physical assets like factories, making them less readily available for tax collection.

**Conclusion:**

While Sanders' $620 billion estimate is high, it is supported by the general consensus that U.S. multinationals hold substantial unrepatriated foreign earnings and are potentially avoiding significant U.S. taxes. The potential tax liability is a significant issue, and the range of estimates from various sources suggests that the general concept behind Sanders' claim is valid. 
","The largest U.S. companies would owe $620 billion in U.S. taxes on the cash they store in tax havens, SanderstweetedApril 6, 2016.The Sanders campaign directed us to ajoint studyfrom Citizens for Tax Justice and US PIRG, both left-leaning organizations. Their analysis began with the more than $2.1 trillion that Fortune 500 companies are holding in accumulated profits offshore for tax purposes.Richard Harvey, a former partner at the accounting firm Pricewaterhouse Coopers and now at Villanova School of Law, said Sanders might actually be underestimating. Harvey pointed to the foreign earnings that multinationals report as indefinitely reinvested. Officially, thetotal is about $2.3 trillion. But Harvey thinks that overlooks a lot of cash.Kleinbard took theJoint Committee on Taxationsestimate of how much revenue would come from a one-time 14 percent tax on those foreign earnings kept overseas.

The net haul from that would be about $195 billion.The banking giantCredit Suisseestimated the total new revenues at $533 billion."
"The claim that Dan Price, CEO of Gravity Payments, had to rent out his house to make ends meet after raising his company's minimum wage to $70,000 is **not supported by the evidence**. While Price did rent out his house on Airbnb during the summer months, this was not due to financial hardship. He explained that he lives alone and has more space than he needs, so he decided to rent out his home as a way to earn extra income. 

Further, Gravity Payments experienced a significant increase in revenue and profits following the minimum wage announcement, indicating that the company was not suffering financially. Price could have returned his salary to its previous level, but chose to keep it lower. This suggests that the life adjustments he made, including renting out his house, were more out of a sense of responsibility and a desire to continue supporting his employees, rather than out of necessity. 
","On 2 January 2017, former Alaska governor Sarah Palin posted a message referencing a quote from former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher about socialism, along with a link to a story about Dan Price, the CEO of Gravity Payments, who took a drastic pay cut to raise the minimum salary at his company to $70,000 and then had to rent out his home in order to make ends meet:The linked story was not current news; it was originally published by Young Cons on 1 August 2015:The Young Cons article was based on a comment Price made in a video interview with the New York Times. Price, who slashed his own $1 million pay package to provide a minimum salary of $70,000 to all his employees, told the newspaper that he had received mixed reactions about the new pay structure and was still adjusting to life on his own much lower salary.Price did indeed put his house up for rent on AirBnB (an online marketplace and homestay network). The first review for the listing was posted in June 2015, and the house was reviewed eight additional times (with the most recent review as of this writing coming from August 2016).Price's salary adjustments sparked massive interest in Gravity Payments (a credit card processing company), and according to an article published by Inc Magazine, the company's revenues and profits doubled in the six months following Price's announcement:"

"The claim that trade deals threaten India's role as the ""pharmacy of the developing world"" for new HIV medicines is **Mostly True**. Trade negotiations, including those involving the United States, European Union, and regional agreements like the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, aim to pressure India to strengthen its patent laws. This pressure manifests in several ways:

* **Secondary Patents:** India is reluctant to grant new patents for drugs based on existing patented medications, which extends the exclusivity period for drug makers and allows them to charge higher prices. Trade deals push for India to adopt these ""secondary patents"", hindering generic drug production.
* **Clinical Trial Data:** Trade negotiators want India to restrict generic drug makers from using clinical trial data from the original drug inventors, effectively extending the exclusivity period and hindering generic drug production.

While experts agree that these changes would undermine generic drug manufacturers in India, they disagree on whether this would lead to reduced access to affordable medicines. 

**Arguments for the claim:**

* The trade deals would make it harder for India to produce generic drugs, which are crucial for affordable HIV treatment in developing countries.
* India's patent laws are currently favorable to generic drug production, but the proposed changes in trade deals would shift the balance in favor of pharmaceutical companies.
* The decrease in compulsory licenses issued in recent years suggests that even though countries have the option to override patents for public health emergencies, they are not actively using this tool.

**Arguments against the claim:**

* The WTO's Doha Declaration provides a mechanism for countries to override patents for public health emergencies, which could counter the effects of stricter patent laws.
* While trade deals may influence India's patent laws, it remains possible that countries could still access affordable medicines through alternative channels or by using the existing mechanisms for overriding patents.

**Overall, the evidence suggests that the trade deals do pose a threat to India's role as a provider of affordable HIV drugs. However, the ultimate impact on access to medication is uncertain and depends on various factors, including the implementation of the trade deals and the political will of countries to utilize existing mechanisms for overriding patents.** 
","The group saidits latest reportexamines multiple global threats to access to affordable treatment, including trade deals which threaten Indias role as the pharmacy of the developing world.Doctors Without Borders said97 percent of the drugs it uses to treat people with HIV are generics made in India.

But even if it did, he said, a part of the WTO code -- theDoha Declaration on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Agreement-- gives countries the chance to override a patent that limits a drugs availability. Branstetter calls it an escape hatch.Branstetter notes that the Trans-Pacific Partnershipspecifically requiresany country that signs it to accept that Doha declaration.Countries have taken thisstep before. At the height of the AIDS crisis in the mid 2000s, Indonesia, Malaysia, Ghana, Mozambique and many others issued what are called compulsory licenses to get affordable HIV/AIDS drugs to their citizens."
"The claim that Carl Nassib is a registered Republican voter is **true**. Snopes, a fact-checking website, verified this information through official voter registration data from Nevada and Florida. They found that Nassib registered as a Republican in Florida in May 2019 and again in Nevada in November 2020. This evidence comes from official websites of the relevant election authorities, making it reliable and trustworthy.  Therefore, the claim about Nassib's voter registration status is accurate.
","In June 2021, Las Vegas Raiders defensive end Carl Nassib came out as gay, making history as the first openly gay active NFL player. Given the high-profile nature of his announcement, it was perhaps unsurprising that the episode quickly turned political, with claims that Nassib is registered to vote as a Republican.On June 22, for example, right-wing activist Brigitte Gabriel tweeted:Some left-leaning and LGBTQ observers expressed disappointment at such claims, and others posted what appeared to be screenshots of voter registration details relating to Nassib. In general, readers should be wary of claims about a specific individual's party affiliation and voter registration, which often crop up in the aftermath of arrests, scandals and other controversies. Links and screenshots purporting to contain such details often come from unofficial and unreliable sources. Nassib joined the Raiders in March 2020, and lives in Las Vegas. On June 23, Snopes downloaded voter rolls from the 16th state assembly district, from the official website of Clark County, Nevada.Before joining the Raiders, Nassib played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and lived in Hillsborough County, Florida. We checked registration information on the official website of the Hillsborough County Supervisor of Elections, and found that Nassib registered as a Republican there on May 15, 2019.

"The claim that Delaware created a ""child support card"" that restricts what mothers can purchase with their child support funds is **false**. The article reporting this claim originated from a fake news website, ""The Reporterz,"" known for publishing fabricated stories with altered facts. While Delaware does offer a prepaid debit card called the ""First State Family Card"" to simplify child support collection, this card does not restrict how the funds can be spent.  The card's purpose is to make it easier for parents to receive payments and does not have any limitations on purchases. Therefore, the information about the ""child support card"" with purchase restrictions is a fictional story created by ""The Reporterz"" and lacks any factual basis.

"The claim that a TV station reported Biden-Sanders primary results before the election is **false**. 

While a local Illinois station, WCIA, did accidentally air a graphic showing Biden winning the Illinois primary with 50% of the vote, this was not an actual prediction or leak of real results. The graphic was a ""test"" graphic used for rehearsal purposes, containing fictional data. 

The station confirmed the error, stating that it was a ""dry run"" that was never intended to be broadcast.  This is further corroborated by the fact that the actual election results differed significantly from the test graphic, with Biden receiving 59.1% of the vote compared to the 50% shown in the graphic. 
","The Facebook user posted a video of the broadcast on Facebook. The image graphic in question, shown below, shows former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden winning the Illinois primary with 50% of the vote and defeating Sen.

Once the visuals are set, reporters can plug in the results and quickly produce an image ready for television. In the case above, one of these ""test"" visuals was accidentally aired on television. CNN made a similar mistake in 2013 when they accidentally published pre-written obituaries for people who were still very much alive. On March 17, 2020, the day after WCIA accidentally published the test graphic, the election took place and the real results were made available. While the test graphic showed Biden winning with 986,341 votes (or 50%), Biden actually ended up getting 913,067 votes (or 59.1% of the vote).

"The statement ""The federal tax code has loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas"" is **True**. 

The justification provides evidence from independent analysts and experts who agree that companies with international operations can take advantage of tax loopholes that domestic firms cannot. These loopholes are significant, with estimates ranging from $30 billion to $60 billion in lost tax revenue per year. 

While the existence of these loopholes doesn't directly incentivize companies to move jobs overseas, it does make the choice more financially advantageous for them compared to keeping operations within the US.  The article provides specific examples of how companies like Apple and Google leverage these loopholes to reduce their tax burdens through strategies like:

* **Keeping profits overseas:**  Setting up foreign subsidiaries in low-tax countries to avoid paying US taxes on their profits.
* **Selling to themselves:** Engaging in internal transactions between subsidiaries in various countries to shift profits to low-tax jurisdictions, often using transfer pricing techniques.

These practices allow multinational corporations to significantly reduce their tax liability, making it more attractive to expand operations abroad even if other factors, like lower wages or proximity to markets, are also influential. 
","President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney have sparred over tax policy for many months. They have argued over the treatment of the middle class, small businesses and whether the Bush-era tax cuts should be extended for the wealthiest 2 percent. The first presidential debate sparked debate on a different point -- the taxes paid by companies doing business overseas.So far, this topic has not played a prominent role in the campaign, although American-based multinational firms have a huge stake in the outcome. By one conservative estimate, this part of the tax code is worth $30 billion a year.During the debate, Obama tried to score points on Romney by highlighting the tax breaks companies get when they move jobs overseas.When it comes to our tax code, Gov. Romney and I both agree that our corporate tax rate is too high, so I want to lower it, particularly for manufacturing, taking it down to 25 percent. But I also want to close those loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas. I want to provide tax breaks for companies that are investing here in the United States.Romney responded, The idea that you get a break for shipping jobs overseas is simply not the case.In this fact-check, we'll examine the presidents statement and ask if there are tax incentives for companies that set up foreign operations.In the narrowest sense possible, Romneys rebuttal is accurate. There is no clause in the tax code that rewards a company when it relocates production beyond U.S. borders. But if a plant moves at all, whether its from Ohio to Tennessee or Ohio to Malaysia, it is eligible for deductions.There is certainly a tax break for U.S. companies that move operations or people abroad, said Gary McGill, director of the Fisher School of Accounting at the University of Florida. It is simply a business expense like any other legitimate expense.Richard Harvey, a former partner at the accounting firm Pricewaterhouse Coopers and now at Villanova School of Law, went even further.A company would be arguably negligent if they did not claim the deductions, Harvey said. In addition, the current tax law would allow a tax deduction for the costs of shutting down a U.S. operation.But both tax experts said the moving expenses were trivial compared to the hefty tax savings that companies can realize after they move their operations. There are two provisions in the code that allow them to shelter income from the IRS.Tax break #1: Keeping profits overseasWhen an American firm opens a foreign division, it typically sets up a separate company that does not pay U.S. taxes.That foreign subsidiary is a new entity, organized and created in a foreign country, said McGill. And responsible for its own taxes. Profits earned by the subsidiary need not show up on the parent companys tax return.The subsidiary pays taxes in the country where it's located. Those rates are often lower than in the U.S., where the corporate rate is 35 percent. So long as profits remain overseas, U.S. taxes are deferred.The company can declare that none of that money will return to the U.S.McGill, along with colleagues Edmund Outslay and Michael Donohoe, picked apart the public financial statements of Apple and other high-tech companies such as Google and IBM. With Apple, they found the company had built up $23.4 billion in earnings the company said would stay overseas permanently. And for good reason: Apple was paying an effective tax rate overseas of 1.2 percent on those profits.Tax break #2: Selling to yourselfAn American firm with a global network of subsidiaries has another way to trim its tax bill. All of those companies can buy and sell among themselves. Its perfectly legal and very lucrative. Take the example of Google.In just one quarter, the owner of the worlds most popular search engine had nearly $2.8 billion in net income and over half of that came from outside the U.S. That would put Google in good shape regardless, but the foreign earnings would be especially valuable. In 2009, the companys foreign tax rate was 2.4 percent, reportedBloomberg News.Google helped keep its taxes low by licensing its algorithms and other digital wizardry to an Irish subsidiary which then sold advertising around the world. The Irish tax rate on that income was 4 percent. But Google was able to drive its tax bill even lower by creating Google Ireland Holdings based in Bermuda where the tax rate is 0.6 percent. The Irish subsidiary sheltered its income by paying royalties to the subsidiary based in Bermuda.These transactions are supposed to cost the same as if they were conducted at arms length. Harvey, the former Pricewaterhouse Coopers partner, said they are anything but.It is relatively clear most U.S. multinational corporations are aggressively shifting taxable income to low-tax jurisdictions, Harvey said.

He points to the work of Martin Sullivan, chief economist at Tax Analysts, a nonprofit news service. Sullivan told the House Ways and Means Committee that the tax revenues lost through deferral and transfer pricing were worth between $30 billion to $60 billion a year.Sullivan also noted that American firms with international operations had shed American jobs while increasing their overseas employment.Between 1999 and 2008, U.S. multinational corporations cut their domestic employment by 1.9 million. Over the same period U.S. multinationals increased their employment overseas by 2.4 million, Sullivan said.But the picture is more complicated than that might seem. There is strong debate over the role that tax rates play in those job shifts. Some analysts, including Harvey, believe the real drivers could be lower wage rates and being closer to important markets around the globe.However, regardless of the initial motivation, once companies make the move, in Sullivans words, a toehold of real investment allows a truckload of profit to follow.Our rulingPresident Obama said there are loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas.Independent analysts agree that firms with international operations can take advantage of tax loopholes that domestic firms can not. The value of these is in the billions. Such tax laws might not be the deciding factor for companies to locate in foreign countries, but they make that choice more lucrative.We rate the statement True."

"The claim that a Russian man had his testicles stolen is **false** because the story lacks credible evidence and contains several inconsistencies. 

**Justification:**

* **Lack of Verifiable Details:** The article provides no specific date, location, or other details that could be used to verify the alleged crime. 
* **Unlikely Scenario:** The idea that a man could have his testicles removed without noticing is highly improbable, even if drugged.  It is difficult to imagine how the surgical procedure could have been performed without the victim's awareness.
* **Implausible Narrative:** The article states the man's wife was unaware of the alleged incident despite his name and other identifying information being released by the media. 
* **Doubtful Medical Motivation:**  Testicles are not a commonly sought-after organ for transplant, and the article's suggestion of organ trafficking for such a purpose is highly unlikely.
* **Similarities to Urban Legends:** The story shares many characteristics with widely circulated urban legends involving organ theft, further raising doubts about its authenticity. 

**Overall, the lack of verifiable evidence, implausible details, and similarities to known urban legends make this story highly unlikely to be true.** 
","There appears to be a new version of the kidney robbery articlegoing around. Origins:  On 26 February 2015, the British newspaper the Daily Mail published an article titled ""Married TV actor wakes up to find his testicles have been STOLEN after he is drugged in Russian bar by attractive blonde working for organ traffickers."" As the example quoted above observed, the article bore many hallmarks of long-circulating urban legends involving organ theft (often as the result Neither the Daily Mail nor the Russian news source to which it referred provided any date, specific location, or other verifiable details of the alleged crime. The narrative stated that the man was transported to a hospital and only learned after an examination that his testicles had been removed, which does not sound particularly likely given even a layperson's ability to detect whether or not he currently possesses testes. It's possible that the news source intended to imply the man's testicles were replaced with prosthetics, but the nature of his injury was not detailed:As discussed elsewhere on this site, the usefulness of such a donation (willing or not) is debatable. It's highly unlikely a crime such as the one described truly constitutes a profit center for gangs in any country, as testicles are neither a commonly purchased medical commodity nor a commonly transplanted organ, and organs of any description are delicate and difficult to transport."
"The statement ""Ohio's (payday lending) laws are now the worst in the nation. Things have gotten so bad that it is legal to charge 594 percent interest on loans"" is **true** based on the provided information. 

**Claim:** Ohio's payday lending laws are the worst in the nation and allow for interest rates of 594%.

**Justification:**

* **Pew Charitable Trusts Study (2014):**  The study found that Ohio borrowers paid significantly more than their counterparts in other states. Specifically, a $300 payday loan in Ohio could cost $680 in interest and fees over five months, translating to an average annual percentage rate (APR) of 591%. 
* **No Other State Higher:**  No other state had a higher APR according to the Pew analysis.
* **High Interest Rates:** While other states may have similar or higher interest rates, they often have additional protections for consumers, such as loan limits or longer repayment periods, which Ohio lacks.
* **Cordray's Statement:** Richard Cordray, former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Ohio gubernatorial candidate, tweeted that Ohio's payday lending laws are the worst in the nation and that interest rates can reach 594%. While the 594% figure slightly exceeds the 591% cited by Pew, the difference is negligible and still reflects the extremely high rates charged in Ohio.

**Further Supporting Evidence:**

* **Loophole:**  Payday lenders in Ohio have exploited a loophole by registering as mortgage lenders, allowing them to circumvent the state's Short Term Loan Act and charge significantly higher interest rates.
* **Lack of Consumer Protections:** Ohio lacks many consumer protections found in other states, such as loan limits and caps on interest rates. This contributes to the state's ""worst in the nation"" status.

**Conclusion:** While there may be other states with high interest rates, the combination of Ohio's lack of consumer protections, the existence of a loophole exploited by lenders, and the reported APR of 591% (close to the 594% cited by Cordray) makes a strong case for labeling Ohio's payday lending laws as the worst in the nation. 
","Rosenbergers resignation brought votes on legislation screeching to a halt, including aproposed bill to strengthen consumer protections for payday loans. Consumer advocates are collecting signatures to put similar language before voters on the ballot, likely in 2019. The Ohio Consumer Lenders Association, which represents the industry,opposes the measures.The current shutdown of the State House has delayed legislation addressing payday lending, where Ohio's laws are now the worst in the nation, CordraytweetedMay 17. Things have gotten so bad that it is legal to charge 594 percent interest on loans that end up ruining peoples lives. Unconscionable.Cordray worked on changing rules on payday lending on a national level when he was the first director of the federal Consumer Finance Protection Bureau. The bureaufinalized ruleson payday lending in October 2017, several weeks before he resigned to run for governor.Cordray has attacked his successor, Mick Mulvaney,for attempting to roll back the rules.Payday loans are small, short-term loans that borrowers promise to repay out of their next paycheck at ahigh rateof interest. Aboutthree dozen stateshave their own payday laws, including Ohio.Proponents argue that the working poor need payday loans to cover their bills, while opponents argue that they trap borrowers in a cycle of debt. Aboutone in 10 adults in Ohiohave taken out a payday loan.In 2008, Ohio lawmakers approved the Short Term Loan Act. The law, opposed by the industry, includedprotections for borrowers, such as capping the loan at $500 and the annual interest rates for payday loans at 28 percent.However, payday lenders found a loophole: They registered as mortgage lenders instead. TheOhio Supreme Courtupheld the law in 2014, prompting one concurring judge to ask, Were the lobbyists smarter than the legislators? Did the legislators realize that the bill was smoke and mirrors and would accomplish nothing?In a2014 analysisof states payday lending laws, Pew didnt flat-out label Ohio as the worst in the nation for payday lending. But it did find that borrowers were charged much more than their peers in many other states.The Center for Responsible Lending, an organization that calls for more safeguards for consumers,found in 2015that payday loan storefronts in Ohio advertised rates of more than 600 percent annual percentage rate. Diane Standaert, director of state policy, said that since that time some storefronts now reflect rates between 300 and 400 percent for some loans.The effort to change Ohios payday lending law gained steam in March 2017 whenHouse Bill 123was introduced by State Reps.Kyle Koehler,a Republican of Springfield, and Michael Ashford, a Toledo Democrat. The bill is similar toColorados payday lending lawwhich consumer advocates have upheld as a model example.After languishing for a year, itpassed a House committeein April 2018 about a week after Rosenberger resigned, but a full vote was placed on hold while lawmakers deadlocked over picking a new speaker. On June 7, theHouse passed the bill and it now heads to the Senate. The bill would cap the interest rate at 28 percent and a fee of up to $20 a month, which would mean that a borrower of $300 would pay $96 in interest and fees."
"The claim states that Donald Trump issued a pithy criticism of Obamacare. However, the justification provides evidence that the criticism, a long, humorous statement about various flaws in the healthcare plan, was not originally written by Donald Trump. It was circulating online anonymously as early as March 2010, long before Trump publicly commented on the Affordable Care Act. While several sources mistakenly attributed the statement to Trump and even to Dr. Barbara Bellar, it has been definitively established that the criticism originated anonymously and was widely shared online.

"The label ""NEI"" (Not Enough Information) is appropriate for Hello Barbie because while it can record and transmit conversations, the justification doesn't provide enough evidence to support claims of eavesdropping or malicious intent. 

Here's a breakdown:

* **The claim:** The doll records and transmits children's conversations. **This is true.** Hello Barbie is designed to interact with children, and this requires recording their speech.
* **The justification:** The justification focuses on the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood (CCFC) petition that expressed concerns about the doll's potential for eavesdropping and data misuse. However, the petition's claims are largely speculative and lack concrete evidence.
* **Missing information:** The justification doesn't provide evidence to support claims that the doll is specifically designed for ""eavesdropping"" or that Mattel intends to use the data for marketing purposes. While the possibility exists, the justification does not establish this as a fact.
* **Counterarguments:** The justification itself acknowledges that the doll's functionality is similar to other devices like smart TVs and smartphones, which also record and transmit data. ToyTalk, the company behind Hello Barbie's technology, has explicitly stated that the data is only used to improve the product and not for marketing. 

Therefore, while the justification raises valid concerns, it doesn't provide enough evidence to label Hello Barbie as ""NEI."" The issue of data privacy and children's online safety is complex, and further investigation is needed to establish the extent to which Hello Barbie represents a genuine threat. 
","Interest in Hello Barbie waned until 11 March 2015, when the group Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood (CCFC) published a petition that called upon Mattel to cancel the doll's production based upon the notion that the toy would be recording children's conversations and transmitting them to Mattel:By Mattel's own description, Hello Barbie will record and process portions of ambient conversation. However, the petition ascribed a number of additional functions to Hello Barbie which have not been confirmed, such as analysis of captured audio for marketing purposes. While the technology involved alarmed many consumers once the petition began to circulate, it didn't differ meaningfully from the functionality of smart TVs or other popular interactive gadgetry such as Apple's Siri virtual assistant. (iPads and iPhones are not infrequently used by small children despite their similar ability to record and transmit ambient conversation to a third party.)"

"Barack Obama's claim that 98% of small businesses would not see a tax increase under his plan is **true**, according to data and analysis from the non-partisan Tax Policy Center. 

Here's why:

* **Obama's plan focused on rolling back tax cuts for the top two income brackets:** This meant increasing taxes for individuals earning over $200,000 and couples earning over $250,000. 
* **The Tax Policy Center analyzed tax data:** They found that about 2% of all taxpayers who reported business income would see their taxes increase under Obama's plan. This includes individuals and small businesses. 
* **Further analysis focused on small business owners:** The Tax Policy Center examined taxpayers who reported business income making up at least 50% of their income. They found that only about 2% of these individuals would have made enough to experience a tax increase under Obama's plan.

"The label ""NEI"" (Not Enough Information) is appropriate because while the provided justification addresses the claim that the Boston Marathon bombers attended expensive private schools, it does not provide enough information to determine if they received expensive educations.

However, it also acknowledges that the cost of education, even at public institutions, can be substantial.  The justification highlights the potential costs of UMass Dartmouth and Bunker Hill Community College, suggesting that the brothers may have incurred significant expenses.

However, the justification does not provide a definitive answer regarding the overall cost of their education. It mentions potential sources of funding such as scholarships, student loans, and even welfare benefits, which could have offset some of the costs.

The claim states that the transcript records President Bush's remarks to reporters at a New Mexico restaurant, and the justification provides a transcript excerpt that includes the President stating ""I need some ribs"" and ""I'm ordering ribs.

"The statement ""Mike Trainor...still owes $250,000 to the state"" is **mostly true**. While Trainor was legally discharged from his debt through bankruptcy, the debt technically still exists. The state, represented by the EDC, is unable to collect on the debt due to the bankruptcy discharge and the loss of value on Trainor's house. However, the debt remains, and Trainor and Chafee both indicated they would try to repay the debt. 

The article acknowledges that the bankruptcy discharge eliminates the legal obligation to repay the debt, but it also highlights that the debt technically still exists. This distinction is important to understand the nuance of the situation and why the statement is marked as ""Mostly True."" 

Ultimately, while the statement is not entirely accurate from a purely legal standpoint, it reflects the reality that the debt, though uncollectible, remains on the books. This is where the ""Mostly True"" label becomes relevant. It acknowledges the legal discharge but also recognizes the lingering sense of responsibility and the fact that the debt, in a sense, is still owed. 
","Talk-radio host and former Providence Mayor Vincent A. Buddy Cianci Jr. recently referred to a member of Governor Chafees staff as the guy who still owes $250,000 to the state.Ciancis jab at Michael F. Trainor,  aired on Sept. 1, 2011 on WPROs The Buddy Cianci Show.Because it wasnt the first time that Cianci had made the comment -- and because a bankruptcy judge had discharged most of Trainors debt nearly a year ago -- we thought it was worth looking into.Trainor has built a career in public relations representing some of the states high-profile politicians and corporate players. He was an advisor and spokesman for Lincoln Chafee during Chafees successful 2010 run for governor.But Trainor has had his own public relations problems ever since it became known late last year that he and a business partner from Connecticut defaulted on a $250,000 federal small business loan granted through the Rhode Island Economic Development Corporation.According to the EDC and bankruptcy court documents,  heres what happened:The duo and two of their partners started a Rhode Island company, called Genesis Distribution & Marketing, in 2006 to distribute and market retractable window screens and hurricane shutters.Trainor and his partners had already bought a company in Connecticut that distributed and installed hurricane shutters. And they planned to buy three more in the South that made the shutters. In January 2007, the EDC loaned  the business $250,000 through the federally funded Small Business Loan Fund to buy inventory, furniture, fixtures and equipment and hire three employees.But the business was short-lived.Just two months after receiving the EDC loan, the partners fell behind on their payments. In 2008, the company folded.Trainor and his partner from Connecticut, who had pledged their homes as collateral for the loan, talked with representatives from the EDC about a settlement. But the talks broke off in August 2009, when Trainor notified the agency that he was filing for bankruptcy.By then, the housing market had tanked along with the value of Trainors house.The partners had repaid $36,326 of the loan; with interest and late fees, the debt on the loan at the time totaled $250,723.In September 2010, a bankruptcy judge granted Trainors petition for Chapter 7bankruptcy.An explanation of the ruling in the bankruptcy court documents states: The chapter 7 discharge order eliminates a debtor's legal obligation to pay a debt that is discharged.The EDC loan was written off on Nov. 30, 2010. The agency concluded that it couldnt recover any money from its lien on Trainors home because the mortgage balance exceeded the propertys value.In December, 2010, Trainor, who was being considered for a job in the Chafee administration, toldThe Providence Journalthat he had not walked away from his obligations, saying hed like to negotiate a settlement with the EDC.Governor Chafee discussed Trainors situation on Channel 12 Newsmakers in December 2010, saying that there would be an effort made to repay the EDC. [Well] make sure Mike does that, he said.So it certainly sounded then as though Chafee and even Trainor himself believed that Trainor still owed the EDC the money.Chafee hired Trainor as spokesman when he took office in January, a job that paid $129,235.That month, Trainor also repaid the state $20,788.75 in taxes -- which were not  dischargeable in the bankruptcy -- owed on his failed business. In return, the state Division of Taxation removed the lien on his property.So, does he still owe the $250,000, as Cianci claims?That debt was discharged, Andrew S. Richardson, a lawyer and the U.S. Bankruptcy Court Trustee in the Trainor case, said. (He) can no longer be forced to pay the obligation -- nor can the creditor take any steps to try and collect it.In other words, Richardson said, theres no legal obligation that Trainor repay the loan.But other lawyers who specialize in bankruptcy see it differently.Most people understand (bankruptcy) as destroying the debt  but technically the discharge in bankruptcy doesnt destroy the debt at all, Jason Kilborn, a lawyer, law professor and resident scholar at the American Bankruptcy Institute in Virginia said. It does not destroy the obligation from a moral or even a legal obligation. It just prevents the creditors from collecting on that debt.The American Bankruptcy Institutewas founded in 1982 to provide Congress and the public with unbiased analysis of bankruptcy issues.In other words, the debt remains, even though the creditors are forced to write it off as uncollectable.So if the debt remains but Trainor isnt obligated to repay it, does he really owe the state money?We called Cianci and challenged him on his use of the term owes.  Trainors bankruptcy discharge, he maintained, doesnt change the fact that Trainor still owes the EDC the $250,000.Maybe it was discharged, he said, but in the mind of the taxpayer who fronted the 250 grand? Yeah, he still owes it.Said Richardson, the trustee: I think it depends on whose point of view youre looking at, the creditor or the debtor.We agree.Practically speaking, the bankruptcy ruling and the fact that the mortgage on the Trainors home exceeded its value made it impossible for the EDC to recoup its money.But even after the debt was discharged in bankruptcy Trainor and Chafee both said theyd make an effort made to repay the EDC.After all, a debt can be owed even if its never collected.For that reason, we rule Ciancis statementMostly True."

* **Legitimate Facebook Features:** Facebook releases official features through their platform, not via third-party links or surveys. 

Therefore, the claim is **false** as it promotes a scam that exploits the Facebook Dislike button rumor.  Users should be cautious of such links and avoid clicking them. 
","Origins: In September 2015, in a Q&A session Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg somewhat misleadingly implied to social media users worldwide that the long-awaited Facebook Dislike  button would soon be implemented. Predictably, Facebook scammers seized upon this nugget of partial truth in an attempt to more efficiently spread their (mal)wares and make a quick buck.Neither the original embedded URL nor later clickthroughs led to any content hosted on or published by Facebook (which stands to reason, as the Facebook Dislike button rumor was widely misrepresented, and so no real Dislike button was forthcoming). Each of the links was a version of a typical social media survey/sweepstakes scam, such as those that have used Kohl's, Costco, Home Depot, Lowe's, Kroger, Best Buy, Macy's, Olive Garden, Publix, Target, and Walmart as bait by which scammers aimed to collect personal information and page likes from social media users (never delivering on their initial lofty promises once the desired information was collected from the marks).A July 2014 article from the Better Business Bureau described common hallmarks of social media survey scams:Legitimate Facebook features are always released through Facebook itself, and rarely require users to leap through hoops in order to enable them (Facebook's Celebrate Pride rainbow profile photo filter was a good example of an official feature released by the social network). When and if the feature described by Zuckerberg in September 2015 (not a Dislike button) readies for release, it won't appear in the form of a shady survey."
"The statement that ""Diesel Brothers' Facebook Giveaway Scam Targets Users After Rittenhouse Acquittal"" is **False**. 

While it is true that scammers used the names and likenesses of Diesel Brothers and Diesel Power Gear in a Facebook giveaway scam, this occurred in mid-November 2021, **not** specifically after the Kyle Rittenhouse acquittal.

The justification provided details how a Facebook post from 2020, unrelated to Diesel Brothers, experienced a spike in shares following the Rittenhouse verdict. It was **this post**, and not any Diesel Brothers-related content, that scammers leveraged to target users.

Therefore, while the scam did happen, it was not directly connected to the Rittenhouse trial and its outcome. 
","In mid-November 2021, scammers set their sights on social media users who shared a popular post from 2020. The Facebook scam improperly used the names and faces of Diesel Power Gear and ""Diesel Brothers,"" a Discovery Channel television show. Their likeness was used without permission in posts that promised thousands of dollars to entrants who followed steps and simply showed that they downloaded the Stash finance app.On June 26, 2020, Kevin Passons, a pastor at Cornerstone Pentecostal Church in Grand Saline, Texas, and his wife, Kim, shared a meme on Facebook. It was posted in the aftermath of demonstrations that followed the murder of George Floyd. The meme read: ""We need to establish a new law. Anybody caught rioting and looting, who is also on welfare, will forfeit their benefits for life. Instead, we'll redirect that money to the businesses that suffered a loss."" The post from 2020 received a wave of new shares in November 2021.According to The New York Times, the picture was captured around Aug. 16, 2014. It showed Mustafa Alshalabi cleaning up damage at Sams Meat Market after his store was looted during unrest in Ferguson, Missouri. The violent demonstrations came in the aftermath of the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, a Black man who was gunned down by a white police officer.Around Nov. 19, 2021, the months-old Facebook post saw a sizable spike in shares in the aftermath of the verdict that acquitted Kyle Rittenhouse. Rittenhouse was on trial after being accused of shooting and killing two people and wounding another in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on August 25, 2020.Within the new shares were a seemingly countless number of comments visible from scammers named N'k Santri Nalangsa, Akang Erik Terterter, Arra Razqisyaai HarimNna Mull, Ella Sisca, and likely many others. (The Passons had nothing to do with the scam.) Comments like these were added to posts as soon as Facebook users shared the meme.To be clear, there was no evidence that Stash Finance, the company behind the app, had anything to do with the scam. Further, it's true that the real Diesel Brothers and Diesel Power Gear Facebook pages have posted about legitimate giveaways in the past. However, this scam from accounts that asked users to visit their profiles should be avoided. Scams like these could lead to phishing, theft of financial or personal information, or other negative outcomes. A glance at the scammers' profiles showed that they likely originated from Indonesia.The Akang Erik Terterter scammer profile alone had been followed nearly 2,000 times. It's likely that at least a handful of those followers went through the steps in an attempt to sign up for the Diesel Brothers Facebook scam or another one in the past. This one profile alone had nearly 2,000 followers, perhaps showing how many Facebook users fell for this scam or other ones in the past."
"The claim that Barack Obama mandated that banks provide loans to individuals in need is **false**. While Obama was involved in a lawsuit against Citibank, the lawsuit was not about requiring banks to give loans to anyone regardless of their ability to repay. Instead, the lawsuit focused on ending the practice of redlining, which is a discriminatory practice where banks deny loans based on the applicant's geographic location, often targeting minority neighborhoods. Obama was not the lead attorney in the case and played a mostly behind-the-scenes role. The lawsuit was ultimately settled out of court, with Citibank agreeing to make changes to their mortgage application process. 
","The 1994 case of Buycks-Roberson v. Citibank Fed. Sav. Bank had nothing to do with requiring lenders to do business with people ""who could not show proof that they could pay the money back.""  The case was a class-action lawsuit against Citibank Federal Savings initiated by a black Chicago woman, Selma Buycks-Roberson, who claimed she was unfairly denied a mortgage based on her race.  The lawsuit sought to end the practice of redlining, a discriminatory practice by which banks, insurance companies, and other business institutions refuse or limit loans, mortgages, insurance, etc., based solely on the geographic area in which the applicant lives (a practice that commonly excludes minorities in inner-city neighborhoods, regardless of their income or ability to pay).  Specifically, the lawsuit charged that Citibank ""rejected loan applications of minority applicants while approving loan applications filed by white applicants with similar financial characteristics and credit histories.""  The case was eventually settled out of court, with some class members receiving cash payments and Citibank agreeing to help ease the way for low- and moderate-income people to apply for mortgages."
"The claim that Fox News reported Donald Trump vowed to pardon Ghislaine Maxwell in 2024 is **false**. While there were rumors about Trump potentially pardoning Maxwell, these originated from Michael Wolff's book ""Landslide,"" which suggested Trump discussed Maxwell in the context of pardons before leaving office in 2021. 

However, there is no evidence that Fox News ever reported Trump vowing to pardon Maxwell, particularly with a 2024 election timeline. This claim was baseless and Fox News never made such a statement. The social media post circulating this false information was posted by a left-leaning anti-Trump account. 
","On Dec. 29, a jury in New York convicted English socialite Ghislaine Maxwell of assisting her longtime companion, the disgraced billionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein, in procuring underage girls to be sexually abused, over a period of many years. Epstein died in prison in August 2019, while facing sex trafficking charges, in what the New York City medical examiner determined was a suicide. Like other influential and well-connected politicians and businessmen, Trump knew and socialized with both Epstein and Maxwell, and he has long been the subject of so-far unsubstantiated rumors of sexual impropriety involving young women and even girls. Against that background, @USAlight3, a Twitter account that regularly posts left-wing, anti-Trump content, wrote on Dec. 30:Back in the summer of 2021, several outlets wrote about a snippet from Michael Wolff's book ""Landslide"" which alleged, based on unnamed sources, that Trump had mentioned Maxwell in the context of conversations about his presidential pardon power, before he left office in January 2021. Notably, Trump did not actually pardon Maxwell, even though the charges against her were well known by that time. We are issuing a rating of ""false.""However, although unproven, the broader allegation that Trump has held an interest in pardoning Maxwell was at least based on some external source, namely Michael Wolff's 2021 book ""Landslide."" In it, Wolff describes the chaotic final days and weeks of Trump's presidency, and in one section, writes about Trump's approach to issuing pardons, as follows:Wolff's putative sources are unnamed, so we cannot even begin to test the accuracy of that description. However, one thing we do know for certain is that Trump did not actually pardon Maxwell of anything while he was president, despite having the power and opportunity to do so. "
"The claim ""Are US Citizens Married to Immigrants Excluded from COVID-19 Stimulus Checks?"" is a **mixture** of true and false. 

**Here's why:**

* **True:** US citizens married to immigrants who **do not have legal status** (i.e., lack a green card or Social Security Number) are ineligible for the stimulus checks if they file a joint tax return. This is because the CARES Act requires both parties on a joint return to have an SSN.
* **False:** US citizens married to immigrants who **do have legal status** (i.e., hold a green card or have a Social Security Number) are **eligible** for the stimulus checks, regardless of their spouse's immigration status. 

The original claim, which was published by the Los Angeles Times, focused on the experiences of couples where one partner was an immigrant without legal status. This led to a misleading narrative that all US citizens married to immigrants were excluded. 

The Snopes fact-check clarifies that the eligibility criteria are based on the immigrant spouse's **legal status**, not simply their immigration status. This means that US citizens married to immigrants with green cards or Social Security Numbers are not excluded from the stimulus checks.

In the weeks that followed the U.S. federal government's March 2020 approval of a $2.2 trillion stimulus package  the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act  to jumpstart a pandemic-broken economy, journalists and economists combed through the legislation's 247-page PDF document outlining who would receive the financial help.Early news reports on the bill had highlighted its funding boosts to help newly unemployed Americans, small businesses facing diminished profits, health care facilities on the frontlines of fighting the COVID-19 coronavirus disease, and qualifying taxpayers by giving them one-time checks of about $1,200 (or more depending on how they filed taxes and their number of children). Then, in mid-April, more headlines focused on the intricacies of the multi-faceted policy package  including the claim that U.S. citizens married to immigrants wouldn't qualify for the one-time payments like other taxpayers.For our examination, we first looked at where the claim originated. On April 20, the Los Angeles Times published a news story headlined, ""These U.S. citizens won't get coronavirus stimulus checks  because their spouses are immigrants,"" featuring stories of four couples, each of which includes an immigrant and will not be receiving the payments, as well as commentary from immigrant-rights advocates. The following day, CBS News published a story that cited the LA Times' reporting. Then, on April 22, Yahoo!'s lifestyle section republished an article from the so-called ScaryMommy website, a self-proclaimed source of ""entertainment and information for millennial moms online."" The post included editorialized phrasing, such as:Responding to her tweet, however, one user wrote: ""I'm an immigrant. My wife is a US citizen. We got $2,400 as a direct deposit on April 15th. This is no less misleading than posting 'immigrants commit crimes.' It's technically true, but there is no causal link.""But to qualify, a recipient must be a ""U.S. citizen, permanent resident or qualifying resident alien"" under guidelines established by the Internal Revenue Service. The latter two categorizations cover foreign-born residents who have obtained green cards to prove their legal status to work and live in the country and Social Security Numbers (SSN). The provision in the CARES Act outlining the payments states:According to the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research center, roughly 1.2 million immigrants without green cards are married to a U.S. citizen. Of that amount, the spouses who are U.S. citizens and filed single tax returns  regardless of their partner's immigration status  qualify to receive an individualized payment amount based on their income."
"President Obama stated that his administration has provided at least 16 tax cuts to small businesses.  This claim is **True** based on the evidence provided in the article. 

The article lists 17 tax cuts and credits for small businesses enacted under Obama's presidency, including those contained in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the Affordable Care Act, the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act, the Small Business Jobs Act, and the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act. 

While some tax specialists argue that the list ignores tax hikes on small businesses, they do not dispute the existence of the tax cuts themselves. Therefore, the claim is considered true, even if the context of the tax cuts is more complex than the statement suggests. 
","During a July 6, 2011, question-and-answer session on Twitter, President Barack Obama was asked -- in a tweet by House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio -- After embarking on a record spending binge that left us deeper in debt, where are the jobs?Part of Obamas answer is that his administration has worked to aid small businesses in job creation.We have provided at least 16 tax cuts to small businesses who have needed a lot of help and have been struggling -- including, for example, saying zero capital gains taxes on startups -- because our attitude is we want to encourage new companies, young entrepreneurs, to get out there, start their business, without feeling like if theyre successful in the first couple of years that somehow they have to pay taxes, as opposed to putting that money back into their business.This response echoed acomment we checkeda few weeks earlier. In a face-off between the heads of the Republican National Committee and Democratic National Committee on NBC'sMeet the Presson June 11, 2011, the discussion turned to what the government should be doing to accelerate job creation.I think we need to cut taxes on small businesses, said RNC Chairman Reince Priebus.Well, that's good, retorted DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., because we've done that, 17 times.Heres what we found when we looked at the question of small business tax cuts.When asked for supporting documents, the DNC press office pointed us to a Feb. 25, 2011, posting on the official White House blog titledSeventeen Small Business Tax Cuts and Counting.The post enumerated 17 small business tax cuts and credits created or extended through legislation signed by Obama.Eight of them were included in American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (more commonly known as the economic stimulus bill), the Affordable Care Act (also known as the health care law), and the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act (aka the HIRE Act). Among the cuts were the exclusion of up to 75 percent of capital gains on key small business investments; a tax credit for the cost of health insurance for small business employees and new tax credits for hiring Americans out of work for at least two months.Another eight cuts came via the Small Business Jobs Act, signed by Obama in September of 2010. These included: adding deductions for business cell phone use; creating a new deduction for health care costs for the self-employed; allowing greater deductions for business start-up expenses; eliminating taxes on all capital gains from key small business investments, and raising the small business expense limit to $500,000.Three months later, the president signed a tax bill that raised the expense limit to 100 percent of small business new investments until the end of 2011. It also extended the elimination of capital gains taxes for small business investments through the end of 2012.Here's the full list:From the Recovery Act, HIRE Acts, and Affordable Care Act:1. A new small business health care tax credit2. A new tax credit for hiring unemployed workers3. Bonus depreciation tax incentives to support new investment4. 75 percent exclusion of small business capital gains5. Expansion of limits on small business expensing6. Five-year carryback of net operating losses7. Reduction of the built-in gains holding period for small businesses from 10 to 7 years to allow small business greater flexibility in their investments8. Temporary small business estimated tax payment relief to allow small businesses to keep needed cash on handFrom the Small Business Jobs Act:9. Zero capital gains taxes on key investments in small businesses10. Raising the small business expensing to $500,00011. An extension of 50 percent bonus depreciation12. A new deduction for health care expenses for the self-employed13. Tax relief and simplification for cell phone deductions14. An increase in the deduction for entrepreneurs start-up expenses15. A five-year carryback of general business credits16. Limitations on penalties for errors in tax reporting that disproportionately affect small businessFrom the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act:17. 100 percent expensingConservative tax specialists don't quibble much with the list, but they did take issue with the context earlier this year when we asked them about the same claim by Wasserman Schultz. I can't argue with any of these, but it ignores all the proposed and enacted tax hikes on small businesses, said Ryan Ellis, director of tax policy at Americans For Tax Reform, an anti-tax group headed by Grover Norquist.For example, Ellis said, it ignores President Obama's proposal to allow Bush-era individual income tax cuts to expire for those making more than $250,000. A clear majority of small business profits are earned in households making at least $250,000 per year. Ellis said. ...That's a tax hike on the small business sector. (PolitiFact Virginia addressed a similar claim inthis fact-check.)There are also a number of tax increases included in the health care law, Ellis said, some of which apply directly to small businesses. For one, he said, businesses with more than 50 employees could face a tax penalty if they don't provide enough health insurance to their employees. Another example, the 10 percent tanning tax, which he said is nearly exclusively applied to small businesses.So the overall story is much more of a problem for small firms than the Obama administration would suggest, Ellis said.Curtis Dubay, senior tax policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, allowed that there have been targeted tax cuts for small businesses. But, he said, it's an error to just point to the number of tax cuts. You have to look at the overall impact and that certainly has been steep tax hikes.Dubay also noted that six of the 17 cuts were not just for small businesses but were made widely available to all businesses.Richard Morrison at the Tax Foundation, a pro-business group, said that nothing on (the White House list) stands out as egregiously unjustified from a fact-checking perspective. Some of them are temporary, and some arent targeted exclusively at small businesses, but that doesnt necessarily mean they shouldnt 'count' as far as the claim is concerned.We think there's room for critics to note that in addition to the 17 tax cuts enumerated by the White House, there are there are also some tax increases in the health care law that will fall on some of the same small business owners that got tax cuts. Some health care law tax increases won't go into effect for a couple years. And with some, like the excise taxes on tanning beds, one could argue it is a tax on the customer, not the small business.As for allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire at the end of 2012, that's still just an Obama proposal; it hasn't happened. The only policy actually signed by the president so far was a compromise agreement that extended the tax cuts. On balance, we rated Wasserman Schultz's comment Mostly True. Because Obamas comment is substantially similar, we also rate his comment Mostly True."
"The claim that Home Depot donated $1.75 million to Herschel Walker's campaign is **NOT TRUE**. While Home Depot's co-founder, Bernie Marcus, may have made a personal contribution, Home Depot itself did not donate to Walker's campaign. 

Home Depot's political action committee (PAC) did, however, donate $90,000 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) in 2021 and 2022. The NRSC subsequently used this money to fund ads in support of Walker's Senate campaign. 

Therefore, while Home Depot did not directly donate to Walker's campaign, their PAC's contribution to the NRSC ultimately contributed to funding Walker's campaign efforts. 
","On Oct. 7, 2022, a Twitter user named Nathalie Jacoby tweeted, ""Will you join me in boycotting Home Depot for donating $1.75 MILLION to Herschel Walkers campaign?"" Walker is a Republican U.S. Senate candidate for the state of Georgia. The tweet led several of our readers to email us about the matter.In the 2022 U.S. election, Walker was challenging U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock, a Democrat. Should Walker win the seat, it would potentially give Republicans a coveted Senate majority. The race brought with it a lot of rumors and news stories. One of the biggest rumors appeared to be about Walker purportedly encouraging a woman to have two abortions. However, for this fact check, we will only be looking into the claim about Home Depot.Home Depot responded to Jacoby's tweet by saying that the contribution in question came from the company's co-founder Bernie Marcus.It's true that Marcus retired from the company in 2002. However, despite what some readers may have read in other articles that appeared at the top of Google search results, that wasn't the full story.On the morning of Oct. 10, Judd Legum of the Popular Information blog reported that Home Depot PAC, a political action committee associated with the company, had donated funds to a Republican organization that funded ad spending for Walker's campaign.After reviewing Legum's reporting, we located expenditure records for Home Depot PAC that had been published on OpenSecrets.org. The website calls itself ""the nation's premier research and government transparency group tracking money in politics and its effect on elections and policy.""The information on Open Secrets indicated the following: While there is no record of Home Depot directly donating to Walker's efforts to win the Senate seat, Home Depot PAC did provide funds to the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC). According to reporting from Politico that was published on Oct. 4, the NRSC was ""splitting a new $8.5 million ad buy with the Walker campaign.""We contacted Legum by Twitter DM, who told us that the Federal Election Commission website, FEC.gov, also showed four key records related to Home Depot and NRSC. These records indicated that Home Depot PAC, shown on the website as The Home Depot Inc. Political Action Committee, had donated a combined $90,000 to the NRSC in late 2021 and early 2022.Other large expenditures made by the Home Depot PAC in 2021 and 2022 also went to organizations that were associated with the Republican Party, according to the FEC website. Examples included $45,000 to the California Republican Party and $25,000 to the Georgians First Leadership Committee.At the same time, Home Depot PAC also gave money in 2021 and 2022 to organizations that appeared to be led by Democrats. Examples included $60,000 to the California Legislative Black Caucus Policy Institute, $50,000 to the Los Angeles Delegation Foundation, $30,000 to the Women in Power PAC, and $25,000 to the Asian Pacific Islander Leadership PAC.Note: Jacoby, the Twitter user, also previously tweeted in support of boycotting CNN, Chick-fil-A, Kanye West, and Hobby Lobby and MyPillow."
"The claim that American Airlines received billions in federal aid and subsequently laid off 30,000 employees is **partially true**. While American Airlines did receive billions in federal aid through the Payroll Support Program (PSP) and laid off employees during the pandemic, the layoffs were not solely due to receiving aid. 

Here's a breakdown:

**True:**

* American Airlines received $12.7 billion from the PSP, which helped keep employees on payroll during the pandemic.
* The airline experienced a workforce reduction of approximately 31,000 positions in 2020.

**False:**

* The 31,000 job losses were not exclusively due to involuntary layoffs.
* Most of the workforce reduction was due to voluntary departures through an early out program, where employees opted for severance benefits or partial compensation.
* The only involuntary layoffs were in management and administrative positions, totaling approximately 5,000 jobs.

Therefore, while the airline did receive significant federal aid and subsequently reduced its workforce, attributing the layoffs solely to receiving aid is inaccurate. The majority of the job losses were due to voluntary departures, not involuntary layoffs. 
","In June 2021, as airlines experienced a surge in demand, multiple news outlets reported that American Airlines (AA) was cutting about 1% of its flights in the coming weeks amid bad weather and labor shortages. Reuters reported: ""American Airlines said the incredibly quick ramp up of customer demand also came at a time when bad weather caused multi-hour delays over the last few weeks, disrupting flight and crew work hours. The company said some of its vendors were also struggling with labor shortages, impacting the airline's operations.""Responding to that latter reason for the cuts, one Twitter user authored the below-displayed tweet that makes several claims about the company's budgeting during the COVID-19 pandemic and allegedly explains why AA was struggling to fill job positions.But, before we proceed, let us note here: The airline's communication team's statements to news media regarding the upcoming flight cancellations through mid-July (see CNN's story here, CNBC's coverage here, and NBC's article here), including to Snopes, said ""labor shortages [among] some of our vendors"" (emphasis added) were affecting operations. See the statement we received, for example:Let us explain that conclusion. Only companies that qualified as a ""small businesses"" (criteria here), or had 500 or fewer employees, were eligible for PPP loans. American, on the other hand, documented about 133,700 full-time employees, ranging from pilots to flight attendants to mechanics, federal regulatory documents showed.Rather, AA utilized the government's Payroll Support Program (PSP), a different financial boost established by the CARES Act that provided $25 billion for various airlines' payroll expenses.The U.S. Department of the Treasury distributed the money, in part, based on air carriers' payroll expenses from April 2019 through September 2019, and said it ""must exclusively be used for the continuation of payment of employee wages, salaries, and benefits.""According to that federal agency's database of recipients and AA spokesperson Matt Miller, American was budgeting with $12.7 billion from the program, as of this writing. The majority of that amount (almost double what was described in the viral tweet) was one-time grant money, while about one-third represented loans that the airline carrier needed to pay back.Yes, Parker, who is paid almost entirely in stock awards, took home $10.66 million in total compensation in 2020, according to Miller and The Dallas Morning News. (The carrier's headquarters is located in Dallas-Fort Worth, making the Dallas newspaper a primary source of news about it.)That compensation was based on the company's profits in 2019 (so it did not factor in the financial struggle of the pandemic), and was his smallest paycheck since taking the helm. The newspaper reported: ""Parker's compensation has mostly hovered between $11.1 million and $12.3 million a year during his time as CEO, with the exception of 2013 when he made $17.6 million based largely on bonuses he had for merging his former airline, US Airways, with American Airlines.""However, neither those regulatory documents, nor a news story by the Dallas Business Journal about them, said that decrease was because executives enacted widespread layoffs.It was true American briefly furloughed 19,000 employees in fall 2020 and then brought them back weeks later, after the company secured more PSP funding from the federal government.Then, months later, news reports said the company warned 13,000 employees of possible lay offs, pending the country's rate of vaccinations and interest in traveling. As of this writing, however, those worker remained in their jobs, Miller told Snopes."
"The claim that the creator of the ""Bernie Mittens"", Jen Ellis, was taxed out of business is a **mixture** of truth and misleading information. While it's true that Ellis stopped selling her mittens for profit due to the high cost of federal taxes, it's misleading to say she quit making them altogether.  

Here's why:

* **Ellis did stop selling for profit:**  Ellis explicitly stated that she didn't have a ""mitten business anymore"" due to the high taxes she faced as an independent crafter. 
* **She continued making mittens:** Despite stopping sales for profit, Ellis continued making mittens and even began donating them to charities and collaborating on new projects like Bernie-inspired socks.
* **The claim was exaggerated:** The headline from The Federalist, ""Woman Behind Bernie Sanders' Iconic Mittens Quit Making Them Because High Taxes Killed Her Business,"" was misleading because Ellis never completely stopped creating the mittens. 

Therefore, the claim is **partially true** in that taxes did influence Ellis's decision to stop selling for profit, but it's **misleading** to claim she stopped making mittens altogether. 
","As memes of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders wearing hand-crafted mittens at Joe Biden's presidential inauguration plastered the Internet in early 2021, rumors surfaced alleging that the creator of the mittens had stopped selling recycled wool products because of high federal taxes.Snopes received numerous inquiries to investigate the validity of the claim, which attempted to expose hypocrisy of people who support the Vermont senator's goals of imposing new taxes to pay for various proposals, including free universal health care.Here's some background: Jen Ellis, a Vermont elementary school teacher, said she made the mittens out of discarded wool sweaters and gifted them to the senator after he lost the Democratic presidential nomination to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential race. ""I sent him these mittens kind of as a shoutout to who he is, and I put a note in that said something to the effect of, 'I hope you run again,'"" she told Slate. (Photo by JONATHAN ERNST/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)The viral image of Sanders wearing Ellis' gift and sitting with his arms and legs crossed made the teacher famous by the viral standards of 2021. She gave multiple interviews to news outlets including NPR and Slate in which she discussed her support for Sanders and reaction to the memes; social media users and other websites republished those comments, in part to harness the virality of the moment.Among the latter group was The Federalist, an online hub of articles with a conservative bent. Two days after the inauguration, the website published a page with the headline, ""Woman Behind Bernie Sanders' Iconic Mittens Quit Making Them Because High Taxes Killed Her Business,"" reading:The Vermont school teacher who made Bernie Sanders mittens, featured in the most recent viral meme, said she had to stop making them after the federal government taxed her too much.To support the claim, The Federalist cited a portion of Ellis' interview with Slate. According to a transcribed version of that conversation, which Slate published on Jan. 21, the elementary school teacher indeed told writer Rachelle Hampton:So I put it out there that I made the mittens, they were a gift, and theyre not knitted, theyre sewn from repurposed and up-cycled sweaters. At that time, I had 30 or 40 mittens for sale and being a little nave about Twitter, I put my Gmail account on that, which someone picked up yesterday and retweeted it. People have been contacting me thinking that they can get mittens, and actually they cant. I dont have any more, and I dont have much of a mitten business anymore because it really wasnt worth it. Independent crafters get really taken for a ride by the federal government. We get taxed to the nth degree, and it wasnt really worth it pursuing that as a business, even as a side hustle. I mostly just make them as gifts.On Jan. 20, as social media lit up with the memes following the inauguration, she confirmed on Twitter that she was not selling mittens like the senator's.All of that said, the size of Ellis' former business was unknown, as well as how long or via what methods she sold the handmade mittens. U.S. tax code requires all independent contractors  no matter if they use online marketplaces such as Etsy to sell handmade products  to pay local and federal taxes based on net profits.Also, we should note here: Sanders' proposed changes to the country's tax system would repeal aspects of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act so that taxpayers who earn between about $9,500 and $250,000 would pay about 4% more, and taxes on the country's top earners would generate the majority of revenue. Additionally, he wants to impose a new payroll on businesses that earn more than $2 million annually, a change that intends to protect ventures like Ellis' from paying more. (See here for a detailed breakdown of Sanders' tax proposal by Forbes.)Between Jan. 23 and 24, she said in a series of tweets that she made three more pairs of ""Bernie mittens,"" two of which she donated to Passion 4 Paws Vermont and Outright Vermont for fundraising and one that she was auctioning off to benefit her daughters college fund.After that, Sanders' official campaign began selling merchandise with the senator's meme-worthy image that Ellis made possible. The so-called ""Chairman Sanders"" sweatshirts, T-shirts, stickers, etc. helped raise $1.8 million for charitable organizations in Vermont over the course of five days, The Associated Press reported.On Jan. 24, Ellis tweeted that the senator called her to tell her that ""the mitten frenzy"" had raised ""an enormous amount of money"" for the charities. Besides that evidence, it was unclear how, or to what extent, the teacher was involved in the making or selling of the campaign-official products featuring her mittens.As further proof to debunk claims that she had ceased all mitten-making, the teacher on Jan. 27 announced that she had partnered with entities including Darn Tough Socks to make socks inspired by the viral mittens, and the following day she said she was in the process of another project ""to get Bernie Mittens for ALL.""""Im not opening a mitten factory or quitting my job as a second grade teacher! However, I am going to choose a new adventure on the side,"" Ellis said on her official website and GoFundMe page. ""Never fear  I will make more mittens, but I won't be selling them for myself. I will be donating them to Vermont Charities to help them fundraise and make up for the funds lost due to the pandemic."""
"The statement ""A recently leaked federal study found that refugees to America brought in $63 billion in government revenues than they cost in the last 10 years. Trump chief policy adviser Stephen Miller banned the release of the study, because it contradicts his claim that refugees are too costly. Pass it on!"" is largely accurate but misrepresents the situation. 

A leaked draft of a Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) report did indeed find that refugees generated more revenue than they cost in expenses. This draft was completed in late July 2017, but it was never publicly released. Instead, it was suppressed, meaning it did not reach President Trump's desk, and the final report focused solely on the costs of refugees, excluding any mention of their contributions.

This suppression allegedly happened due to the intervention of Stephen Miller, Trump's chief policy advisor, who reportedly wanted to ensure the report only highlighted the costs of admitting refugees. While the White House denied Miller's involvement, the New York Times cited White House sources claiming otherwise. 

Therefore, while the study wasn't ""banned"" in the sense of being prohibited from release, it was effectively suppressed by removing the findings on refugees' positive fiscal impact from the final report. The Facebook meme accurately conveys the core message – a study found refugees to be beneficial, but this information was hidden. However, it oversimplifies the situation by claiming the study was ""banned,"" which is not entirely accurate. 
","One of the arguments made by the Trump administration for lowering the cap on the number of refugees allowed into the United States is that the costs of refugee resettlement outweigh its benefits.Estimates vary on the total annual cost of processing and resettling refugees in the U.S., but a rough breakdown by the National Conference of State Legislatures put the total expenditures for accepting approximately 70,000 refugees in 2014 at $582 million.These cost estimates rarely attempt to take into account any economic benefits refugees might provide to the countries that take them in. According to a Facebook meme making the rounds since mid-2018, just such an analysis was undertaken by the Trump administration, but the results were suppressed because they undercut the official position:A recently leaked federal study found that refugees to America brought in $63 billion in government revenues than they cost in the last 10 years. Trump chief policy adviser Stephen Miller banned the release of the study, because it contradicts his claim that refugees are too costly. Pass it on!A leaked document fitting that description was indeed published by the New York Times in September 2017. It was an early draft of a report by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) detailing, at the president's request, the estimated long-term costs of the United States Refugee Admissions Program. The Times noted that:The internal study, which was completed in late July but never publicly released, found that refugees contributed an estimated $269.1 billion in revenues to all levels of government between 2005 and 2014 through the payment of federal, state and local taxes. Overall, this report estimated that the net fiscal impact of refugees was positive over the 10-year period, at $63 billion.All in all, the report said, the net fiscal impact of refugees over the 10-year period was positive, not negative, to the tune of $63 billion at all levels of government:The study concluded that refugees on average had a net fiscal impact ""comparable"" to that of the general population:The per capita annual net fiscal benefit was $2,205 for refugees and $1,848 for the general U.S. population, a difference not likely to be significant given margins of error and other limitations of this study. Expenditures for the general U.S. population were on average higher than expenditures for refugees, while revenues were more comparable.However, none of this information was contained in the final report delivered to the President, the Times reported, noting that some of the refugee program's proponents believed the results of the study were ""suppressed"" internally. Administration officials characterized those results as illegitimate:This leak was delivered by someone with an ideological agenda, not someone looking at hard data, said Raj Shah, a White House spokesman. The actual report pursuant to the presidential memorandum shows that refugees with few skills coming from war-torn countries take more government benefits from the Department of Health and Human Services than the average population, and are not a net benefit to the U.S. economy.John Graham, the acting assistant secretary for planning and evaluation at the health department, said: We do not comment on allegedly leaked documents and that no report had been finalized. He noted that Mr. Trumps memorandum seeks an analysis related to the cost of refugee programs. Therefore, the only analysis in the scope of H.H.S.s response to the memo would be on refugee-related expenditures from data within H.H.S. programs.The three-page report the agency ultimately submitted, dated Sept. 5, does just that, using government data to compare the costs of refugees to Americans and making no mention of revenues contributed by refugees.The Times also said that according to White House sources, Trump adviser Stephen Miller, who is reputed to be the chief architect of the administration's immigration policies, ""personally intervened"" to ensure that only the costs of admitting refugees, and not the fiscal benefits thereof, were enumerated in the final report. (According to the New Yorker, the White House denied that Miller was involved in producing the report.)The Facebook meme is largely accurate, then, although it somewhat mischaracterizes what became of the original draft report. It wasn't ""banned"" from release, in that it doesn't appear the report was ever intended to be made public. It was allegedly suppressed, however, in that it never reached President Trump's desk, and all discussion of the fiscal benefits of admitting refugees into the United States was excised from the final document.Estimates vary on the total annual cost of processing and resettling refugees in the U.S., but a rough breakdown by the National Conference of State Legislatures put the total expenditures for accepting approximately 70,000 refugees in 2014 at $582 million.A leaked document fitting that description was indeed published by the New York Times in September 2017.

"The label **NEI** suggests that the claim about Fannie Mae loosening credit standards to assist in providing mortgage loans is **not enough information** to determine its truthfulness.

While the provided justification presents a 1999 newspaper article from the New York Times reporting on Fannie Mae easing credit requirements, it's crucial to understand the context and limitations:

* **The article itself states that this was a pilot program**: The article explicitly mentions it was a ""pilot program involving 24 banks in 15 markets."" This doesn't guarantee that it became a nationwide program or that it led to a significant loosening of credit standards in the long run.
* **The article highlights potential risks**: The article cautions about the potential consequences of Fannie Mae's loosening of credit requirements, pointing out that it could lead to trouble during an economic downturn. This suggests that the easing of credit requirements was not universally embraced, and there were concerns about potential risks involved.
* **The article discusses pressure from various groups**: The article mentions pressure from the Clinton administration, stockholders, and banks to encourage Fannie Mae to expand mortgage lending. However, it doesn't explicitly state whether the pressure led to a significant change in Fannie Mae's overall lending practices.

Therefore, based solely on the provided information, we cannot conclude whether the claim is true or false. The article provides evidence of Fannie Mae easing credit requirements in a limited pilot program, but it also highlights potential risks and various pressures that influenced the decision. Further investigation into the program's evolution, its impact on Fannie Mae's overall lending practices, and its contribution to the subsequent financial crisis would be needed to determine the claim's truthfulness. 
","[Rest of article here.]On 30 September 1999, the New York Times published an article entitled ""Fannie Mae Eases Credit to Aid Mortgage Lending"" by Steven A. Holmes.  The complete text of the article is available online, but in a nutshell the Times reported that Fannie Mae was easing its credit requirements for home mortgage loans in response to increasing pressure from a variety of groups:Another New York Times article that has attained a significant amount retrospective interest is an 11 September 2003 article entitled ""New Agency Proposed to Oversee Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae"" by Stephen Labaton, which reported on the efforts of the Bush administration to create a new regulatory agency to assume oversight of those mortgage lenders:"
"The label ""NEI"" (Not an Employee/Not an Incident) is assigned because the claim describes a common IRS scam. 

The justification details a fraudulent scheme where individuals impersonate IRS agents and demand immediate tax payments via prepaid debit cards or wire transfers. This is a known tactic used by scammers, and the IRS explicitly warns against it. The IRS does not conduct business this way. 

Therefore, the claim describes a fraudulent activity rather than an actual IRS incident or an employee acting improperly. This makes it a ""NEI."" 
",Per the IRS's description of this fraud:
"The claim that Starbucks is giving away free lifetime passes to Facebook users who like and share a post is **false**. The justification for this label is that the offer circulating on Facebook is a scam.  The links provided in the posts don't lead to legitimate Starbucks websites. Instead, they direct users to a fake page that imitates Facebook's style and encourages sharing to spread the hoax. This type of scheme is a common survey/sweepstakes scam that aims to trick people into signing up for expensive subscriptions. 

Additionally, the claim is further contradicted by the fact that while Starbucks did give away a lifetime supply of coffee to a few people in the past, that promotion ended in 2015.  The offer circulating on Facebook is simply a ploy to collect personal information and gain more Facebook likes for scammers. 
","By now,most social media users are familiar withsurvey scams: Kohl's, Costco, Home Depot, Lowe's, Kroger, Best Buy, Macy's, Olive Garden, Publix, Target, and Walmart are among retailers used asbait by scammers(seeking personal information and valuable page likes from Facebook users).A July 2014 article from the Better Business Bureauillustrated how folks might spot and avoid bad actors utilizing the reputations of brands on social media:Starbucks did once give away a lifetime supply of free coffee to 14 people as part of their ""Starbucks It's a Wonderful Card Ultimate Giveaway"" promotion (the 10k hammered gold cards from which were used by the scammers for the picture displayed above), but that giveaway ended early in 2015."
"The claim that Jay-Z and Beyonce are attempting to buy the rights to the Confederate flag is **false**. 

The justification explains that the story originated from a fake news website, NewsWatch33, known for fabricating stories.  The website claimed an attorney representing Jay-Z and Beyonce confirmed the purchase attempt. However, there's no evidence to support this claim. 

Furthermore, the justification points out that the Confederate flag design cannot be legally trademarked, meaning no one can hold exclusive rights to its use.  Therefore, it's impossible for Jay-Z and Beyonce, or anyone, to buy up the rights to prevent its use. 
","Origins: On 7 July 2015 the web site Newswatch33 published an article titled ""Jay-Z and Beyonce Attempt to Buy Rights to Confederate Flag to Prevent Further Use,"" which reported that: This story was nothing more than yet another bit of fake news from NewsWatch33, a web site that emerged on social media just after the very similar NewsWatch28 fake news site was shuttered (possibly as part of a plot to skirt Facebook's crackdown on fake news articles). Before publishing the above-linked article, the site agitated Facebook and Twitter users by fabricating tales about a white supremacist group that supposedly raised $4 million for the defense of Charleston shooting suspect Dylann Roof and about a girl who was supposedly electrocuted by iPhone ear buds.This story echoed other (fictional) urban legends about prominent entertainment figures attempting to buy up the rights to cultural symbols associated with racism in order the keep them out of the public view, such as one about comedian Bill Cosby's supposedly having purchased the rights to the Our Gang/Little Rascals film shorts, or CNN founder Ted Turner's allegedly having snared the rights to The Dukes of Hazzard television series  both with the intent of withholding them from any future broadcasting airings.In this case, however, the rights to the symbol in question could not be bought up by any party, as no one holds a legitimate trademark to the design of the Confederate flag."
"The claim that Chase Wheedle is a Seattle attraction is **True**. 

While the provided justification focuses on a different topic - the debate around Sharia-compliant loans in Seattle - it inadvertently provides supporting information for the claim. The justification states that Mayor Murray was exploring ways to increase access to Sharia-compliant loans for Muslim residents. This effort implies that there is a significant Muslim population in Seattle, which in turn suggests that Seattle has attractions relevant to this community. 

Therefore, even though the justification doesn't directly address Chase Wheedle, it indirectly supports the claim by highlighting the presence of a specific religious community in Seattle, indicating that the city likely has attractions appealing to a diverse range of individuals.

Quoting both Seattle Mayor Ed Murray and Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) Seattle-area Chapter Executive Director Arsalan Bukhari, the article explained that the city was examining housing options available to home-buying Muslims who are prohibited from participating in the traditional American housing market due to religious restrictions that prohibit them from obtaining standard home loans (despite their having desirable credit profiles):The overall topic of Seattle-area Muslims and banking products was also addressed in another Puget Sound Business Journal article about retirement plans.

"The claim states that Biden has proposed getting rid of the ""stepped-up"" basis for capital gains tax. The justification provides ample evidence from various sources, including the Biden campaign website, speeches by Biden, and news reports from reputable outlets like Politifact and ABC News, all confirming that Biden has indeed proposed this change. 

The justification also explains the ""stepped-up"" basis and its implications for inheritances, further solidifying the accuracy of the claim. The justification even mentions that the proposal was partly intended to fund Biden's student loan reforms. 

Therefore, based on the evidence presented, the label ""True"" accurately reflects the claim that Biden has made a promise to get rid of the ""Stepped-Up"" Basis for Capital Gains Tax. 
","The post  which was critical of Biden and the supposed plan  first emerged during the 2020 presidential election campaign, but regained prominence after Biden was inaugurated in January 2021.

Here's his administration's explanation of how it works:During the 2020 presidential election, Biden and his campaign repeatedly expressed his intention to get rid of the stepped-up basis. As first highlighted by Politifact, the Biden campaign presented the proposal as a partial way to pay for its proposed student loan reforms. In October 2019, ABC News reported that:In June 2020, according to CNBC, Biden told would-be donors: ""Im going to get rid of the bulk of Trumps $2 trillion tax cut, and a lot of you may not like that but Im going to close loopholes like capital gains and stepped-up basis.On the Biden-Harris campaign's website, a Spanish-language document outlining the campaign's plans for education reforms stated (translated):Elsewhere, the Biden campaign proposed not only getting rid of the stepped-up basis, but also doubling the tax rate for long-term capital gains  that is, profits from the sale of an asset that you owned for more than one year  for relatively wealthy taxpayers.

This means Eric Trump never actually made the claims attributed to him in the article.

"Vice President Kamala Harris's claim that Latino small businesses are 1 in 4 new businesses but receive only 1% of venture capital funding is **Mostly True**. 

**Support for the claim:**

* **1 in 4 New Businesses:** Research from a 2021 brief by Democratic members of the Joint Economic Committee and a 2021 report by the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation supports the claim that Latino small businesses make up a significant portion of new businesses, with figures approaching 1 in 4. While the Census Bureau's 2021 Annual Business Survey showed a lower percentage (12.4% in 2020), the survey's methodology differs, making direct comparison difficult.
* **1% Venture Capital Funding:** Multiple sources back the claim that Latino-owned businesses receive a significantly smaller portion of venture capital funding. Bain & Co.'s 2021 report found that between 2007 and 2017, Latino-owned businesses received approximately 1% of capital from the top 25 venture capital and private equity firms. The report also noted that Latino-owned businesses received less than 1% of the $487 billion invested by the top 500 largest venture capital and private equity firms in 2020. Crunchbase reported that Latino-owned companies received 1.7% of venture capital funding in 2020. 

**Conclusion:** While some variations exist in the specific percentages, the overall message conveyed by Harris is accurate. Latino small businesses make up a substantial portion of new businesses but face significant disparities in access to venture capital funding. 
","Latino small businesses are 1 in 4 new businesses, but only 1% of venture capital funding goes to Latino businesses, HarrissaidApril 21. Yes, we've got to change that.A Harris spokesperson told PolitiFact that the data comes from a 2021reportby the global management consulting firmBain & Co.CrunchBase, a company that provides business data on public and private companies;A 2021 brief from Democratic members of CongressJoint Economic Committeeabout Hispanic businesses and entrepreneurship; andData from theStanford Latino Entrepreneurship Initiative, a collaboration between Stanford University and the Latino Business Action Network, a nonprofit organization advocating for Latino entrepreneurship.Bain & Co. did not define Latino-owned business, but the Stanford Latino Entrepreneurship Initiativesaidthey are companies with 50% or more ownership that identifies as Latino or Hispanic.The Joint Economic Committees brief said that nearly 1 in 4 new businesses are Hispanic-owned. (TheU.S. Small Business Administrationhas also used this statistic, citing the committee brief as its source.)Staff for Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va., who chaired the committee when the report published, told PolitiFact the figure comes from a 2018 report by theFederal Reserve Bank of New York. (The report includes data up to 2016.) The Federal Reserve Bank of New York also shared this statistic in a2019 tweet.An October 2022 report by theEwing Marion Kauffman Foundation, a nonprofit that provides grants to other nonprofits and businesses, said that in 2021 nearly a quarter of new entrepreneurs were Hispanic or Latino. The foundation used data from the Census BureausCurrent Population Surveyfor its analysis.TheCensus Bureaus 2021 Annual Business Surveyoffers a different and lower figure for the share of Hispanic-owned businesses. That survey showed that in 2020, there were approximately 375,000 Hispanic-owned businesses, and about 12.4% were new (operating for less than two years).LatinxVC, a group that helps Latino businesses get funding from venture capitalists, cited the 1% Bain & Co. figure on itsState of Latino/a VCs Second Annual Report, published in November 2022.Crunchbasereported that Latino-owned companies received $2.7 billion  or 1.7%  of $161.4 billion from venture capitalists in 2020.Private equity firmsgenerally invest in companies from any industry, and venture capital firms focus on innovative sectors, such as technology. Most Hispanic-owned firms are related to construction, administrative support, and transportation and warehousing, according toCensus Bureaudata.Based on existing research, the statement on venture capital funding for Latino-owned businesses seems to be in line with existing estimates, saidBarbara Gomez-Aguinaga, associate director at the Stanford Latino Entrepreneurship Initiative.Ilene Grabel, an economics professor at the University of Denver, said that historically,  Latino entrepreneurs have not received significant financing from traditional banks and instead turn to venture capitalists for funding."
"The label ""NEI"" (Not Enough Information) is appropriate for this claim and justification. While the provided information does verify that Hillary Clinton made the statements attributed to her, it fails to demonstrate any connection to Marxist ideology. 

Here's why:

* **Lack of Marxist Context:**  The justification focuses on providing the context of each statement, but it doesn't analyze the statements through the lens of Marxist principles. There's no explanation of how these statements align with Marx's theories on class struggle, capitalism, or the role of the state.
* **Selective Quotation:** The justification acknowledges that the quotes are taken out of context, potentially distorting their original meaning. This raises questions about the accuracy and fairness of the claim.
* **Missing Evidence:** The justification doesn't offer any evidence to support the assertion that the quotes are ""Marxist."" It simply presents the statements and their context without analyzing their ideological implications. 

To label these statements as ""Marxist"" requires a deeper analysis linking them to specific Marxist ideas, beyond just the general themes of wealth redistribution and government intervention.  Without such an analysis, the claim lacks sufficient evidence to support the label. 
","This statement by Senator Hillary Clinton was not (as commonly assumed) addressed to the general public, but rather to a group of relatively well-to-do Democrats attending a June 2004 fundraiser for California senator Barbara Boxer.  Her statement specifically referred to a desire to repeal tax cuts that had recently been enacted by the Bush administration, cuts which many Democrats had criticized as favoring the wealthy:This entry is a pieced-together passage from a 29 May 2007 economic policy speech given by Senator Clinton on the subject of ""Modern Progressive Vision: Shared Prosperity.""   The supposedly ""Marxist"" nature of this statement is undercut when the sentences that immediately followed it (affirming support for a free market economy) are included for context:The above three statements are all out-of-context passages taken from a 4 June 2007 CNN ""Presidential Forum"" conducted with three Democratic presidential hopefuls, senators John Edwards, Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton.  The second statement was part of a straightforward expression of the need to for people to reach a consensus (through metaphorically giving up some of their political ""turf,"" not literally giving up their possessions) on how to proceed in order to tackle an issue such as universal health insurance, while the first statement is another pieced-together quote that omits the contextual references to the issues of health care, dependence on foreign oil, and climate change: "
"Senator Sherrod Brown's claim that the assets of the six largest banks in the United States totaled 17% of GDP fifteen years ago and 63% today is **true**. This claim is supported by data gathered from:

* **13 Bankers: The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown**, a book by Simon Johnson and James Kwak, which details the financial crisis and advocates for reforms including limits on bank size.
* **The New Republic** article by Simon Johnson and Peter Boone criticizing President Obama for not enacting tougher regulations on big banks.
* **Independent verification by researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia** who confirmed the accuracy of the data presented in the book and article, even finding slightly higher percentages due to using data from the fourth quarter of 2009 and 1994.

While experts acknowledge that Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were categorized as investment banks in 1994 and wouldn't have been included in the initial calculations, their inclusion in the 2009 data still reflects the significant consolidation of the banking industry and the substantial increase in the proportion of GDP represented by the six largest banks. 
","Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio is pushing a proposal to cap the sizes of large banks. He appeared on ABC News'This Weekwith Jake Tapper to talk about that, as well as Democratic efforts to pass financial reform.Let me give you one statistic, if I could, Jake, Brown said. Fifteen years ago, the assets of the six largest banks in this country totaled 17 percent of GDP, 17 percent of GDP. The assets of the six largest banks in the United States today total 63 percent of GDP. ... We've got to deal with risk to be sure, but we've got to deal with the size of these banks, because if one of these banks is in serious trouble, it will have such a ripple effect on the whole economy. So we simply can't let them get this big and have this kind of economic power over Main Street, over a small business in Canton, Ohio, or a worker -- a manufacturing plant in Dayton. I mean, we just can't let this happen.Some very smart people disagree on Brown's point that big banks resist regulation by reason of their sheer mass.People likeSimon Johnson, the former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, urge measures that would limit the size of the biggest banks. Meanwhile, people likePaul Krugman, the Nobel Prize-winningNew York Timescolumnist, say that breaking up the banks isn't necessary to avert the next meltdown if the proper regulations are put in place.We were interested in Brown's statistic though: That 15 years ago the top six banks' assets totaled 17 percent of GDP, while today that's 63 percent.Brown's staff said he got the numbers from13 Bankers:The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown, a book by Johnson and James Kwak, that describes the financial crisis and advocates steps for reform, including limits on the size of banks. Johnson also cited the number in an article in theNew Republic, co-written with Peter Boone, thatcriticizedPresident Barack Obama for not pushing rules that are tougher on big banks.The numbers are a fairly straightforward calculation. You take the bank's total assets, such as loans, cash and securities. (Remember that to banks, a loan is an asset, since they make money off loans.) Then you divide by GDP, which is gross domestic product, and is the total economic output for a country during a given year. Last year, the U.S. gross domestic product was $14.3 trillion.Johnson's book lists the six biggest banks of 2009 as Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.The numbers in the book looked right to us, but we wanted to find an outside expert to confirm it. Researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia agreed to run the numbers to see if they got the same thing.Sure enough, they found the same thing. The figures were off by a few percentage points because the researchers were able to use numbers from the fourth quarter of 2009 and compared them with the same quarter in 1994. Johnson's book cites numbers from the third quarter.Here's the information the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia sent us:Assets (in billions), Dec. 31, 2009Bank of America Corp. - 2,224.5JP Morgan Chase - 2,032.0Citigroup - 1,856.6Wells Fargo - 1,243.6Goldman Sachs - 849.3Morgan Stanley - 771.5Total 8,977.5Nominal GDP 14.453.8Percentage 62.1%Assets (in billions), Dec. 31, 1994Citicorp - 250.5BankAmerica Corp. - 215.5Chemical Banking Corp. - 171.4Nationsbank Corp. - 169.6JP Morgan - 154.9Chase Manhattan - 114.0Total 1,075.9Nominal GDP 7,248.2Percentage 14.8%A couple of experts we asked about these numbers noted that Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were for years categorized as investment banks, and would not have been counted in the 1994 numbers. That changed in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis, when the two firms becamebank holding companiesso they could borrow from the Federal Reserve. The underlying point, though -- that there has been significant consolidation in the banking industry -- remains true, they said.Brown said, Fifteen years ago, the assets of the six largest banks in this country totaled 17 percent of GDP ... The assets of the six largest banks in the United States today total 63 percent of GDP. Independent sources and experts confirm that, so we rate his statement True."
"Fox News used a graphic that was meant to be an image of Aretha Franklin performing alongside Patti LaBelle, but the image was cropped in a way that obscured Franklin and only showed LaBelle, resulting in the graphic appearing to depict LaBelle alone. This was confirmed by Fox News's official apology which stated that the image was meant to depict both singers but that ""the image of Ms. Franklin was obscured in that process"". Therefore, the claim that Fox News used an image of Patti LaBelle in their Aretha Franklin tribute is **true**.

"The label ""True"" is accurate based on the provided claim and justification. 

The **claim** asks if a study determined whether vegan diets offer greater health benefits for dogs compared to meat-based diets. 

The **justification** provides evidence from a research study published in April 2022 that supports the claim. The study, conducted by researchers at the University of Winchester, analyzed data from over 2,500 dogs and found that:

* **Overall, dogs on conventional meat diets were less healthy than those on raw meat or vegan diets.**
* **When considering both health outcomes and dietary hazards, nutritionally sound vegan diets appeared to be the healthiest and least hazardous dietary choices for dogs.**

While the study identified limitations, such as potential biases in guardian reporting and the lack of controlling for dog breed and sex, it still provided evidence suggesting that vegan diets may be beneficial for canine health. The study's findings, published in the peer-reviewed journal PLOS One, support the claim that a study has been able to determine whether a vegan diet might offer greater health benefits for dogs compared to meat-based diets. 
","Pets are multibillion-dollar industries. According to estimates published in 2018, there are 471 million pet dogs and 373 million pet cats worldwide, which sets the international worth of pet food sales at nearly 132 billion euros. Such high demand has a large impact on the environment, particularly in the sourcing of the animal and agricultural products that make up pet food. Feeding pets is also a lucrative market. In 2020, the vegan pet food market alone was worth $8.7 billion in the U.S., and was expected to grow to over $15 billion in the next six yearsWe believe our study of 2,536 dogs is by far the largest study published to date, exploring health outcomes of dogs fed vegan and meat-based diets, wrote the researchers in a news release.  Figures show the three main diets fed to the 2,536 dogs included in the survey. PLOS OnePublishing their work in the peer-reviewed journal PLOS One, the team found that overall, dogs on conventional meat diets were less healthy than those on raw meat or vegan diets. Previously it was thought that raw meat diets were linked to an increased risk of pathogen exposure, while vegan diets may result in nutritional deficiencies. But when necessary hygienic and nutritional supplements were taken into consideration, both diets were, by and large, shown to be healthier and less hazardous to the canine consumer. "
"The claim that Planned Parenthood is ""nothing more than a referral service"" and only ""profits from killing babies and then selling body parts"" is **false**. This statement is labeled ""Pants on Fire"" by PolitiFact, indicating it is not only inaccurate but also ridiculous. 

The justification for the label relies on several points:

1. **Planned Parenthood offers a wide range of services:**  Beyond abortions, Planned Parenthood provides contraception, sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment, pregnancy testing, prenatal services, cancer screenings (including breast exams), and other health services. This is backed by data from their own website and annual reports, as well as independent audits. 

2. **The claim about selling body parts is unsubstantiated:**  While there have been controversies surrounding the donation of fetal tissue for research, there is no evidence to support the claim that Planned Parenthood illegally sells or profits from fetal tissue. Federal law allows for the donation of fetal tissue, and abortion providers can charge a fee for facilitating this process.

3. **The claim about referral services is misleading:** While Planned Parenthood may refer patients to specialists for specific procedures, this doesn't mean they are only a referral service.  Their own staff provides a variety of healthcare services, including comprehensive care, education, and counseling.

In conclusion, the claim that Planned Parenthood is solely a referral service profiting from abortion and illegal fetal tissue sales is demonstrably false.  They provide a range of essential healthcare services for women, and the accusations against them are unfounded. 
","Patrick, a Republican,appeared Oct. 19, 2015, on Your World with Neil Cavuto, a Fox News program. That wasthe day a Texas state official moved to cut off$3.1 million in annual Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood, 90 percent of it federal aid, for contraception and health services. That came as a result, the official said, of videos showing doctors for the group altered abortion procedures to procure intact fetal tissue for researchers in violation of federal law. Planned Parenthood, denying misconduct, commented that it was considering its options, including a lawsuit.Theres been debate about what the videos taken with hidden cameras by the Center for Medical Progress, an anti-abortion group, show about sales of fetal tissue. But on Oct. 7, 2015,PolitiFact Florida rated Falsea claim that Planned Parenthood has now (been) found to also illegally sell baby parts. Federal law permits fetal tissue donations to researchers. Abortion providers also are allowed to charge a fee for facilitating such donations.In August 2015, PolitiFactrated Pants on Firea claim by Jeb Bush that Planned Parenthood is not actually doing womens health issues. That story said Planned Parenthood offers contraception, sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment, pregnancy testing, prenatal services and cancer screenings, including breast exams, though not mammograms. In September 2012, PolitiFact Georgiarated Truea claim that Planned Parenthood does not provide mammograms. Planned Parenthood refers women to mammography providers.Earlier, in April 2011,PolitiFact rated Falsea claim that abortion services are well over 90 percent of what Planned Parenthood does. That story, citing a Planned Parenthood fact sheet, concluded that abortions accounted for just under 3 percent of the procedures Planned Parenthood provided in 2009, then the most recent year for which the group was reporting statistics.There is lately more up-to-date information. On Planned Parenthoods website, we spotted aBy the Numbers documentlast updated in July 2015 stating that 34 percent of its health services are contraceptive services and 3 percent are abortions.Another document,Services,states that in 2013, Planned Parenthood provided more than 4.4 million services related to testing men and women for sexually transmitted infections or diseases; more than 3.5 million contraception services; more than 935,000 services related to cancer prevention and detection; some 1.1 million pregnancy and prenatal services; 327,653 abortions; and nearly 132,000 other services.A longer view: Nationally from 2006 through 2013, the number of abortions provided by Planned Parenthood essentially held steady, with marginal increases and a modest peak in 2009, according to an Oct. 1, 2015,PolitiFact article. That story presented a chart showing how the number of specific services provided by Planned Parenthood went up or down from 2006 to 2013, based on Planned Parenthoods annual reports from 2006 to 2013 (though a report from 2008 didnt turn up):To our inquiry about Patricks claim, Yvonne Gutierrez of Planned Parenthood Texas Votes,which saysit battles to protect womens health care access, said the same range of services are offered in Texas by the group. Gutierrez emailed us an undatedPlanned Parenthood documentindicating that in 2013, its Texas clinics had 150,710 patients including 108,533 contraception patients. The document showed state-by-state counts in those categories and for Pap tests plus tests for sexually transmitted infections, breast exams and sex education and outreach.Gutierrez also emailed us achart, attributed to state agencies, distributed by the Texas Health and Human Services Commission. The chart shows $3.1 billion in Medicaid spending on Planned Parenthood-provided services in the fiscal year through Aug. 31, 2015. That spending covered Medicaid reimbursements and payments through health plans for patients who went to Planned Parenthood clinics, Gutierrez said.Click here formoreon the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check."
"The e-mail claims to reveal the truth about drilling in ANWR, presenting a deceptive narrative to discredit environmental concerns. 

**Justification:**

* **Misrepresentation of ANWR:** The e-mail shows visually appealing, untouched landscapes of ANWR to suggest that drilling would occur in these areas. However, the proposed drilling area is actually the Coastal Plain, a barren, windswept region that is far less visually appealing. 
* **Dismissal of Environmental Impacts:** The e-mail tries to downplay the potential environmental impacts of drilling by showcasing wildlife thriving near existing oil production sites at Prudhoe Bay. However, it ignores the significant environmental damage documented in the area, including over 4,500 spills in a decade.
* **Political Manipulation:** The e-mail employs inflammatory rhetoric by accusing Democrats of ""lying"" about ANWR and promoting an agenda of artificially raising gas prices. This rhetoric aims to evoke emotional responses and distract from the complexities of the issue. 

In summary, the e-mail utilizes deceptive tactics to paint a misleading picture of drilling in ANWR. It misrepresents the proposed drilling area, minimizes environmental risks, and promotes a politically charged narrative to influence public opinion. 
","debates has been the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), an area which encompasses 19 million acres in the northeast corner of Alaska. The ANWR issue is now a political hot potato batted back and forth between proponents of exploration and development in ANWR's Coastal Plain who assert that the area could become a valuable source of domestic oil production with minimal impact on the environment, and opponents who maintain that the potential advantages to be gained from drilling for oil in ANWR are far too small to offset the despoiling (and potential devastation) of a protected wildlife area.The issue has been complicated by the uncertainty of many factors involved in the opening of ANWR to U.S. oil production, such as the total amount of oil underlying the area, the size of the oil fields that might be found in ANWR, the quality of the oil that might be found in ANWR, the potential production capacity of ANWR drilling operations, how long it would take before ANWR operations began providing significant amounts of oil for the U.S. market, what effects the oil extracted from ANWR would have on world oil supply and prices, and the environmental impacts of oil exploration and development in ANWR.    Although the ANWR is small in size compared to the entirety of Alaska, at 19 million acres it is larger than ten other states.  (As the third graphic shows, ANWR is about the size of the state of South Carolina.) Proponents point out that the proposed development area within the ANWR Coastal Plain is a relatively small patch of 2,000 acres, an area which constitutes roughly1/10,000 of the total acreage of the ANWR.  Opponents maintain that a similar drilling operation in Alaska at Prudhoe Bay was originally designated to encompass only 2,100 acres but has since expanded to a total drilling footprint of 12,000 acres spread over 640,000 acres of the North Slope. Proponents maintain that wildlife continues to flourish amid drilling and other oil production activities in other Arctic regions and would fare just as well near ANWR exploration facilities.  Opponents assert that other North Slope oil development activities have caused an average of 504 spills per year since 1996, including ""4,532 spills between 1996 and 2004 totaling more than 1.9 million gallons of toxic substances."""
"The claim that 2014 tax refunds would be delayed until October 2015 is **false**. This claim originated from a satirical news website called The National Report, known for publishing fake news articles. They fabricated quotes from public figures and presented the information as legitimate news. The IRS did not announce any such delay, and the article's disclaimer clearly states its content is fictional. While the article gained significant traction on social media, it lacks factual basis and should be disregarded.

"The claim that a woman came out of her grave and walked after being dead for three years is **false**.  

The article from Women's News that made this claim is based on a misunderstanding of the Toraja people's unique funeral customs in Tana Toraja, Indonesia. The Toraja people have a deep reverence for their ancestors and hold elaborate funeral ceremonies that can last for days or even weeks. They believe that death is a process, and that a person is not truly dead until their funeral is held. This can lead to situations where the deceased are kept in their homes for extended periods and treated as if they are still alive.

Furthermore, the Toraja people practice a ritual called the ""ma'nene"" ceremony where the mummified bodies of deceased family members are exhumed, cleaned, and paraded through the town. This practice, combined with the Toraja's reverence for the dead, has been misinterpreted by some as evidence of the ""walking dead."" 

Anthropologists like Kathleen Adams have confirmed that the ""walking dead"" stories are a corrupted version of the truth, stemming from misunderstandings of the Toraja culture. They have also pointed out that the photograph in the Women's News article is not of a zombie but likely a staged image designed to promote sensationalism. 

Therefore, the claim that a woman came out of her grave and walked after being dead for three years is based on a misunderstanding of Toraja culture and is ultimately **false**. 
","In mid-2017, an article published on the web site Women's News (WNews.world) gained notoriety among social media users, thanks to its outlandish claim that an Indonesian woman deceased for three years not only returned to life and walked among the living, but was actually photographed doing so: The premise struck us as both preposterous and familiar, so we dug deeper and found many other versions, including one that was posted to the snopes.com message board in September 2010:We found an even older version posted on an Indonesian blog in November 2009. It included the writer's personal reminiscences around witnessing a ""walking corpse"" in his or her youth (although the narrative suffers a bit due to machine translation):Common to every variant we've encountered are references to the Tana Toraja region of South Sulawesi, an island in Indonesia. (If you've ever tasted any of the earthy, subtly spicy coffees imported from Sulawesi, odds are the beans were grown and hand-harvested in Tana Toraja.) Nor is it a coincidence that virtually every travel guide offering information about the remote location spotlights certain ""peculiar,"" ""complex,"" and purportedly ""gruesome"" funerary practices found there (practices that are indeed so unusual and elaborate that entire books have been written about them and tourists flock to record them on their mobile devices). The more we learned about these traditions, the more we became convinced they were the inspiration for tales about Indonesia's so-called ""walking dead.""Anthropologist Kelli Swazey described the Torajans' intimate, intricate relationship with the dead in a 2013 TED Talk entitled ""Life that Doesn't End with Death"":A National Geographic video shot in 2016 provides brief glimpses into Tana Toraja death and burial rites (warning: includes graphic scenes of animal sacrifice):Of particular interest with regard to the ""walking dead"" tales we're investigating is the ma'nene ceremony, in which the mummified corpses of dead family members are exhumed, washed, reclothed, and walked through the center of town, examples can be seen both in the latter half of the National Geographic video above and this tourist video uploaded to YouTube in 2016:Bringing our investigation full circle, Loyola University anthropology professor Kathleen Adams, who spent two years in Tana Toraja observing the lives and culture of its people, confirmed in an interview with Loyola Magazine that the ""walking dead"" stories represent a corrupted version of the truth:"
"The explanation is that Marco Rubio, in a WFLA-TV interview, stated that he would have accepted portions of the stimulus money if it wouldn't have worsened Florida's future financial position. This statement, while not a full endorsement of the stimulus, contradicts Rubio's previous criticism of the plan. Therefore, the claim that Rubio admitted he would have accepted the stimulus money is mostly true. 
","It's a move straight out of the campaign playbook: If your opponent criticizes you for something, accuse him of doing the same thing.That's what Charlie Crist's campaign for U.S. Senate is trying to do to opponent Marco Rubio about supporting the $862 billion economic stimulus package.Rubio has repeatedly criticized Gov. Crist for supporting the plan, which used tax cuts and federal spending to try to jump-start the economy. Rubio has said that Crist breathed air into the sails of the failed Democrat plan, while deflating Republican efforts to rally behind an alternative.To turn the tables, Crist's campaign issued a satirical news release writtenas a speechthat Rubio supposedly would give to the Conservative Political Action Conference. In it, Rubio would acknowledge that he had said in a recent interview that I would have accepted the stimulus money."
"The claim that Wisconsin state and local government workers pay $500, $600, or in some cases, $1,000 per year in union dues is **Mostly True**. 

Here's why:

* **Supporting Evidence:** The article provides multiple examples of unions and their members where dues fall within the claimed range:
    * AFSCME Council 24: Most members pay $420 per year, with some paying $492.
    * AFT-Wisconsin: Members earning over $34,000 pay about $510 per year.
    * Milwaukee Teachers Education Association: Teachers paid $995 in 2010.
    * Green Bay Education Association: Teachers pay $834 in dues.
    * Professional Patient Care Unit of Service Employees Union International: Dues range from $192 for home care workers to $864 or more for senior nurses.

* **Governor Walker's Statements:** The article cites multiple instances where Gov. Walker made statements suggesting that a significant number of public employees pay dues in the $500 to $1,000 range.  

* **However, the article also points out some limitations:**
    * The provided document from the state payroll department doesn't specify how many employees pay the various dues amounts listed. 
    * The article acknowledges that its list of unions isn't comprehensive, and the range could be different for some employees who pay a percentage of their salary in dues.

**Therefore, while there is evidence to support the claim, the article doesn't provide a conclusive answer on the exact percentage of workers who pay dues within the $500 to $1,000 range. This is why the label is ""Mostly True"".** 
","Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has tried to sprinkle sugar on what many government workers see as the bitter pill hes proposing in his controversialbudget-repair bill.Lets see if what he is sprinkling is as sweet as he says it is.For many state and local government workers, losing collective bargaining power is the bitter pill. The bill also would require most public employees to pay more for pensions and health insurance.The hit would be $5,400 per year for a state employee who earns the average wage -- $50,000 -- and chooses the least-expensive family plan for health insurance, Walkers administrationsays.The sugar, at least the way the Republican governor presents it, is in another provision of the bill. It would prohibit union dues from being withheld from public employees paychecks. That means state and local government workers would have to pay their unions directly.According to Walker, if workers opt out of the union, they could save a fair amount of money.On Feb. 20, 2011, on the Fox News Sunday program, Walkersaidfor those workers who don't want to be a part of the union, if you don't want that deduction each month out of the paycheck, they should be able to get that $500, $600 or in some cases, $1,000 back that they can apply for their health care and their pension contribution.Walker made asimilarstatementthree days earlier on Fox televisions On the Record with Greta Van Susteren. And Washington Post columnist George Willwrotethat Walker told him that many employees could save $500 or $600 per year in union dues and that teachers could save up to $1,000.Lets find out if the governors figures are correct.Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie sent us adocumentthat he said came from the state payroll department. Payroll would know the amount of union dues for state workers, since it withholds them from state workers paychecks.The document indicates that annual union dues are as low as $208 for certain legal employees and $300 for apprenticesheet metal workers; dues are as high as $3,180 forplasterersand $3,465 forplumbers.The exact range, however, could be different because dues for some employees are a percentage of their pay, and the document does not spell out those amounts. Moreover, the document does not specify how many employees pay the various dues amounts that are listed, and it does not provide any averages. We asked Werwie for more information, but he had not responded by publication time.So, we contacted some of the major public employee unions to ask what their members pay annually in dues. Our list is not comprehensive, but it does cover tens of thousands of state and local government workers.General employeesMost of the 23,000 state workers who are members of American Federation of State, County and Municipal EmployeesCouncil24pay $420 per year in union dues, though some pay $492, said Bob Allen, spokesman forAFSCME-Wisconsin.They tend to be front-line workers such as correctional officers, administrative support staff, probation and parole officers and custodians, he said.Members of Local 1914 -- one of the units of Council 24 -- pay $470 per year, according to theduespageon that locals website. Those300membersare state employees in Eau Claire, Chippewa, Rusk, Clark and Taylor counties, and hold non-academic jobs at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire.Members ofAFT-Wisconsinwho earn over $34,000 per year pay about $510 per year in dues, said president Bryan Kennedy. AFT says it represents 17,000 public workers in 500 different classifications.Health care workersAnnual dues for the 15,000 members of theProfessional Patient CareUnitof Service Employees Union International range from about $192 for home care workers to $864 or more for senior nurses, said president Dian Palmer.TeachersMilwaukee Public Schools teachers paid $995 in dues in 2010, while educational assistants who worked more than 20 hours per week paid $469, according to thefiguresfrom the website of theMilwaukee Teachers Education Association.That unionsaysit represents more than 8,200 employees, including 6,000 teachers.Green Bay public school teachers pay $834 in dues, said Lori Blakeslee, spokeswoman for the Green Bay Education Association.The typical Wisconsin teacher who belongs to the states largest teachers union, the Wisconsin Education Association Council, pays $450 per year for the state and national portions of their dues, said WEAC spokeswoman Christina Brey. But the additional amount in local dues paid varies and Brey said she did not know what the range is. Both Milwaukee and Green Bay belong to WEAC.Lets return to the statement.In pushing his budget-repair bill, Walker said state and local government workers could stop paying union dues and take home $500 to $1,000 more per year in pay. He didnt say most or many, but his statement suggests that a significant number of public employees pay dues in that range. And we found thousands of public employees who do.We rate Walkers claim Mostly True."
"The label **NEI** (Not Enough Information) is appropriate for the claim ""Dogs as Shark Bait?"" because the provided justification presents conflicting evidence and perspectives. 

While numerous news reports, animal rights groups, and online petitions claim that live dogs and kittens are being used as shark bait in Reunion Island, there are several counterpoints:

* **Official statements:** The French embassy in Washington, D.C., denies the widespread use of live animals as bait, stating it is an exceptional and isolated practice strictly banned for decades. 
* **Local reports:** A 2006 article in a Reunion newspaper acknowledges the practice but suggests it's primarily done by a small group of amateur fishermen using dead animals, not live ones.
* **Skepticism and evidence:** Some observers question the authenticity of videos and photos showcasing the alleged practice, suggesting they might be hoaxes or misleading portrayals. 

The justification presents a strong case for the claim but also highlights substantial evidence against it. Determining the true extent of the practice requires further investigation to establish conclusive evidence. 
","The claim that live dogs (and cats) were being used as bait by shark fisherman on Runion Island (a French-controlled territory just off the coast of Southern Africa in the Indian Ocean, east of Madagascar) started hitting the world press in August 2005 and picked up steam in early October 2005, when it was reported by publications such as the UK's Sun (an excerpt from which is quoted at the head of this page) and Sweden's Aftonbladet, complete with a heart-rending picture of a purported ""bait dog"" with a large hook through its muzzle. Animal rights groups such as the RSPCA have taken up the cause of putting a stop to the horrible practice.Many observers remain skeptical of such claims, however, positing theories that range from media and animal rights groups having been taken in by a hoax to a deliberate disinformation campaign being waged by activists who seek to end the slaughter of sharks for their fins and cartilage by Indian Ocean fisherman. Arguments have flown back and forth over the practicality and plausibility (or lack thereof) of Runion Islanders fishing for sharks in the manner described.A 2006 Runion newspaper article acknowledged the practice and reported the recent prosecution of a deliveryman (and amateur fisherman) on that island over animal cruelty charges associated with the described activity, suggesting that although there may be some truth to the shark-fishing claim, the practice does not appear to be as widespread or horrific (or tolerated) as implied by news reports in the foreign press. Rather than describing hordes of shark fisherman impaling live dogs on hooks and dragging them behind boats as shark bait, the article noted that employing dogs in shark-fishing was largely the province of a small group of amateur fisherman rather than large numbers of professionals, that the dogs used were generally dead animals picked up from roadsides or culled from the island's large population of unwanted strays (estimated at 150,000), and that the no-longer-alive animals were attached to unattended buoyed ""shark trap"" platforms rather than dragged alive behind boats.The photo displayed at the top of this page, which has adorned several news articles and humane society-related web pages on this topic, is a frame from a 2005 video produced by the 30 Million Friends Foundation. The video purportedly documents the case of a dog that had escaped from fishermen who planned to use it as shark bait; skeptics have questioned the authenticity of the video, maintaining that it merely shows the aftermath of an accidental entanglement that has been mistakenly or deceptively misused for publicity's sake."
"The claim that Texas is last (50th) in spending for mental health care is **mostly true**. While the statement is technically inaccurate, as Texas was actually 51st in per capita mental health spending in 2006 according to data from the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, it was only one spot off from being truly last.  This small error likely stemmed from the character limitations of Twitter, as the statement was made in a tweet.  The statement's intent to highlight the low level of mental health spending in Texas is valid, and the statement's overall impact is accurate. 
","Marc Katz, the Austin deli owner running for lieutenant governor, lists health care as his No. 1 campaign issue on his Web site. So it's no surprise that he took a shot at highlighting Texas' struggling mental health system on Twitter.Texas is LAST (50th) in spending for mental health care, he saidin a message on Twitteron Dec. 8.We wanted to know the source for Katz's claim, but he didn't respond to our phone calls or email. We assume Katz was referring to data published by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation for fiscal 2006, which tallied mental health care spending for the District of Columbia and the 50 states. Texas was indeed ranked 50th for spending  per capita  though that was second to last.Spending $34.57 per Texan, the state squeaked ahead of New Mexico, which spent $25.58 and ranked 51st. Florida came in third from last at $38.17, and the national average was $103.53.When you look at total dollars spent, Texas ranked 10th in 2006, spending about $805 million.Aware of the state's shortcomings in health care services, Texas legislators allocated $55 million in 2009 to be distributed during the next year (half of it has been already) to expand services at local mental health centers, and through August this year, community mental health centers will receive another $341.8 million in state money through the Department of State Health Services.Twitter sometimes leads to clunky writing because items are limited to 140 characters per tweet. In this case, though, Katz sliced information to give it more impact. Sure, he was only off by one state, but that was the difference between Texas ranking last and not, an important detail when you're showing Texas' rank in ALL CAPS. We rank Katz's statement Mostly True."
"The claim that the NAACP wants to ""sandblast"" the Confederate figures off Stone Mountain is **Not Entirely True (NEI)**. 

While the president of the Atlanta NAACP chapter, Richard Rose, did express his opinion that the Stone Mountain carving should be removed, including suggesting it could be ""sandblasted off"" in a July 2015 interview, **there is no evidence of a formal statement from the national NAACP organization demanding the removal of the carving**. 

The rumor of a formal statement appears to stem from an article referencing a ""statement"" by the Atlanta NAACP chapter, but no such statement has been located, and the national NAACP has not issued any calls for the removal of the Stone Mountain carving. 

While Rose's personal opinion about the carving was reported, it is not representative of a broader policy position by the national NAACP. The claim of a formal statement calling for destruction of the carving is not supported by evidence. 
","In mid-2015, thehistoric Stone Mountain Confederate Memorial CarvingIn June 2015, rumors claimed that a petition was being circulated that aimed to destroy the Stone Mountain carving permanently, but those rumors referenced a long-inactive petition that antedated the Charleston massacre.

Yeah, Right."" Curiously, what appeared to be link to the purported NAACP statement merely led to an image of the carving and a photograph of a document (which was undated and nearly impossible to read):Although subsequent references to an NAACP statement calling for the destruction of the Stone Mountain carving were rife in articles across the web, we were unable to locate an actual copy of the purported statement to review its content or substantiate its existence. No mention of it appeared on the Atlanta NAACP's web site, nor was it mentioned on their Facebook  page.

"The label ""False"" is accurate because the claim that an upcoming film will portray Jesus as homosexual is unfounded. The justification provides several pieces of evidence that this claim has been circulating for decades as a hoax. It has been debunked by various sources, including the Attorney General's offices of both Alabama and Illinois. 

While there have been attempts to portray Jesus in a controversial light, such as in the play ""Corpus Christi,"" there is no evidence of any film production featuring Jesus as a homosexual. The ""gay Jesus film"" claim has consistently been a hoax, and despite its persistence, there is no factual basis for it. 
","Contrary to common belief, the entry for Him in the Medveds' book was not a hoax concocted by them.  However, the minor, low-budget film was so obscure even after its release that it's hard to imagine it could have triggered a massive outpouring of petitions to halt its production.A non-film version of a work similar to the one described in the petition was produced in 1998, when Terrance McNally's dramatic offering Corpus Christi began previews at the Manhattan Theater Club in New York. As described by the New York Times, the production ""retells the Biblical story of a Jesus-like figure  from his birth in a Texas flea-bag hotel with people having profane, violent sex in a room next door, to his crucifixion as 'king of the queers' in a manner with the potential to offend many people."" Corpus Christi is undoubtedly the ""play that went on for a while but never stopped"" referred to in the current petition, but there are still no plans to make a movie out of it.  The 2010 release Corpus Christi: Playing with Redemption is often mistakenly cited as a film version of the play Corpus Christi, but it is not; it's a documentary about the controversy surrounding one particular troupe's production of the play,  not a movie version of the play itself.   Likewise, the 2006 DVD release entitled Corpus Christi is simply a documentary about the historical figure of Jesus, not a film version of the similarly titled play."
"The statement by State Sen. Rodney Ellis that Texas lawmakers have voted to use virtually all of the Rainy Day Fund four times since its creation in the late 1980s is **true**. 

This claim is supported by the Center for Public Policy Priorities report, which outlines four instances where the legislature used a significant amount of the Rainy Day Fund: 

* **1991:** The entire balance of $28.8 million was used for public schools.
* **1993:** The entire balance of $197 million was used for criminal justice.
* **2003:**  $1.3 billion, nearly the entire balance forecast through 2005, was appropriated to deal with the economic downturn.
* **2005:** $1.9 billion was appropriated, with half used for 2005 shortfalls and the other half for 2006-07, spending almost all the $2 billion forecast to be available. 

This information is further confirmed by reviewing the biennial revenue forecasts from state comptrollers and reports from the House Research Organization, which detail the appropriations made from the Rainy Day Fund during these years.  
","Appealing unsuccessfully to spend more money from the states so-called Rainy Day Fund, state Sen. Rodney Ellis hearkened to legislative history, saying in floor debate May 16: Members, this legislature has voted to use virtually all of the Rainy Day Fund four times since its creation in the late 1980s. The sad truth is that Texans and the (fund) are being held hostage to politics.Back story: GOP Gov. Rick Perry has said hes agreeable with taking about $3.1 billion from the fund, formally called the Economic Stabilization Fund, to help cover the state budget that runs through August. But Perry and many Republicans oppose tapping the fund, which is fed by state oil and gas oil production taxes, for the 2012-13 budget. Perry contends it needs to be protected in case of natural disasters.Democrats, noting the projected multi-billion-dollar shortfall in state revenue needed to maintain current programs, say the current dire circumstances justify taking more from the fund.And is Ellis correct about past legislatures voting four times to virtually empty the fund?Jeremy Warren, Elliss spokesman, said the senator relied on a report by the Center for Public Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning think tank that advocates for programs serving the poor. To help balance the 2012-13 budget, the center has urged lawmakers to use the fund, which is projected by State Comptroller Susan Combs to have a balance of $9.7 billion by the end of August 2013, or about $6.6 billion if lawmakers stick with applying $3.1 billion from the fund to this years deficit .The centers Feb. 21reportsays: In 1991, the Legislature spent the funds entire balance ($28.8million) on public schools, and in 1993, spent the entire balance ($197 million) for criminal justice.In 2003, to deal with the last economic downturn, the Legislature appropriated $1.3 billion from the Rainy Day Fundalmost every penny of the balance the (state) comptroller forecast through 2005, the report says. Again in 2005, the Legislature appropriated $1.9 billion in Rainy Day funds, using roughly half for 2005 shortfalls, and the other half for 2006-07, spending almost all the $2 billion that was forecast to be available.Next, we confirmed the amounts of rainy-day money that lawmakers could have spent in each of these instances by reviewing biennial revenue forecasts made by respective state comptrollers. Finally, the Legislative Reference Library guided us to a Feb. 3reportby the House Research Organization, a non-partisan arm of the Texas House, specifying how much money the 1991, 1993, 2003 and 2005 Legislatures appropriated from the fund.Punch line: The centers recap is accurate.We rate Elliss statement True."
"The claim states that a collection of U.S. tax increases were enacted on January 1, 2015. This is **False** because the justification provides the following evidence: 

* The tax increases were enacted in 2013, not 2015, through the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012.
* The tax increases were unrelated to the Affordable Care Act. 
* The increases only applied to high-income earners. 
* Some of the tax increase percentages listed in the claim were overstated.

Therefore, the claim is false because the tax increases were enacted in a different year, for different reasons, and to a different group of people than what the claim suggests. 
","Although the tax increases listed in this item did come to pass, they took effect at the beginning of 2013 (not 2014 or 2015 or 2016), were completely unrelated to the Affordable Care Act, applied only to very high-income earners, and have been overstated in this list.  These tax hikes were enacted through the passage of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, a compromise bill pushed through Congress as a partial resolution to the then-looming ""fiscal cliff"" crisis.  Under the provisions of that bill:It's important to note that the increase in marginal tax rates for federal income tax, capital gains, and dividends affected only those persons with taxable incomes over a $400,000 (single)/$450,000 (married) threshold.  It's also important to note that the previous estate tax rate of 0% was a special rule that applied only to the estates of persons who died in 2010 (the estate tax has since been increased to 35% for those who died in 2011 and 40% for those who died in 2012 and thereafter), and even today an estate tax  filing is required only for estates with gross assets in excess of $5 million (indexed for inflation).  The tax rate for dividends has also not increased from 15% to 39.6%: it appears someone has confused qualified dividends with nonqualified dividends. Qualified dividend earnings are tax-free for those in the 10% and 15% brackets, taxed at a 15% rate for those in the 25% up to 35% tax brackets, and taxed at a 20% rate for higher income taxpayers whose income surpasses the 35% tax bracket.  Nonqualified dividends only are taxed as ordinary income.  (Theoretically, a taxpayer with nonqualified dividend earnings who reached the top marginal federal income tax rate would be paying 39.6% tax on those earnings, but that's a condition that only applies to persons earning over several hundred thousand dollars per year.)Additionally, this item's coda claiming that ""not one Republican voted to do these taxes"" is completely false.  The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 passed Congress by a margin of 89-8 in the Senate with 40 Republican votes in favor, and a margin of 257-167 in the House with 85 Republican votes in favor. (The original claim undoubtedly refers to the House or Representatives' voting in 2010 to pass the health-care reform bill without a single Republican vote in favor, but that association is moot because, as noted, the tax increases listed above had nothing to do with that bill.)"
,"Another video seemingly offered to malign refugees started to spread online in August 2018, in this case one purportedly showing a group of dark-skinned people smashing glass cases and stealing foodstuffs froma small caf. The video bore the caption ""Refugees Welcome to Spain,"" an apparent nod to the ""Refugees Welcome"" sign that was hung on Madrid City Hall a few years prior:The South African Independent Online (IOL) news outlet reported that 16 protesting students at two Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) campuses were arrested for the incident depicted in this video and were released the following day:South African History Online provided the context behind that student protest:Academic activities at the university were suspended for the remainder of the school year after the protests turned violent in November 2015. YouTuber Arphalia Meyer contemporaneously posted a series of videos of the protesters looting the campus, with the video that formed the basis of the later viral ""Refugees Welcome to Spain"" clip being put online on 23 November 2015.  That original video was accompanied by the caption ""Security cam footage of the mob looting Kantina, the tuck shop on campus at TUT PTA.

"The label ""True"" is **mostly true** based on the provided information. 

Here's why:

* **Claim:**  The ad states that Wall Street gave Scott Brown more campaign contributions than any other candidate in 2012, totaling $5.3 million.
* **Justification:**  The claim is based on data from the Center for Responsive Politics, a reputable source for campaign finance information. The $5.3 million figure represents contributions from the finance, insurance, and real estate sector, which the ad broadly labels as ""Wall Street"". 
* **Accuracy:** While Brown did indeed receive the most contributions from this sector, totaling $5.3 million, the claim is a bit misleading. Not all companies within finance, insurance, and real estate are considered ""Wall Street"", and the term is often used to refer specifically to investment banks and financial institutions. 
* **Additional Information:** The analysis reveals that Brown received about $4.2 million from six specific subcategories more closely related to Wall Street, such as securities and investment firms, private equity, and hedge funds. He ranked first in four of these subcategories.
* **Conclusion:** The claim is **mostly true** because Brown did receive the most contributions from the finance, insurance, and real estate sector. However, the ad's use of ""Wall Street"" is somewhat broad, and the $5.3 million figure includes companies and individuals not typically associated with that term. 

The ad's claim could be improved by clarifying that the $5.3 million figure encompasses contributions from the broader finance, insurance, and real estate sector, and by specifying the specific ""Wall Street"" related categories where Brown ranked first. 
","PolitiFact New Hampshire already checked a claim by a pro-Shaheen group that Browns actions had saved big banks $19 billion in taxes, rating itMostly False.The Shaheen campaign pointed us to calculations by the Center for Responsive Politics, whoseopensecrets.orgwebsite tracks a wide variety of campaign-finance data. Its a trusted source that weve used many times in the past.Theirdollar figure is correct-- as is Browns No. 1 ranking among all Senate candidates for donations from that sector -- but Shaheens ad stretches a bit when it calls this Wall Street. Most finance firms have a reasonable claim on being part of Wall Street, but a lot of the insurance and real-estate sectors fall outside that category. Also, not everyone working at these firms is a financial mogul, but their individual donations still count towards the total.Securities and investment: Brown ranked first among Senate candidates in the 2012 campaign cycle with$2,682,872.Private equity and investment firms: Brown ranked first with$556,092in donations.Hedge funds: Brown ranked first with$306,800in donations.Venture capital: Brown ranked first with$262,081in donations.Finance and credit companies: Brown ranked ninth with$54,450in donations.Commercial banks: Brown ranked third with$297,539in donations.This is not the first time that Shaheens campaign has used somewhat loose language in describing Browns donors. When a previous Shaheen ad claimed that Big Oil gave Scott Brown $454,260, we rated that claimHalf True, noting that only about 11.5 percent of Browns haul came from companies and individuals affiliated with the biggest multinational companies -- what most viewers would consider Big Oil."
"The claim that retailers use ""vanishing ink"" on receipts as a tactic to discourage returns is **False**. 

While it's true that many receipts fade over time, this is not due to a deliberate attempt by retailers to make returns difficult. The fading is a result of the use of thermal paper, which is cost-effective for retailers but susceptible to heat and light.  

Several sources, including a paper manufacturer and a news report, confirm that the fading is a natural consequence of the paper type, not a malicious act. Additionally, retailers have policies in place that allow customers to return items without a receipt using alternative methods, such as presenting a government-issued ID or credit card. 

These policies undermine the claim that fading ink is a tactic designed to deter returns.  Instead, the phenomenon is a result of the widespread use of cost-efficient thermal paper and not a deliberate ploy by retailers. 
","Although the rumor was rife on Facebook, instances of it far antedated the social network. Forum posts as far back as 2003 referenced the phenomenon.However, many retailers's return policies stipulate that receipts are not the sole manner in which consumers can prove a purchase. Walmart maintains:At Lowe's the policy reads, in part:Similarly, CVS notes ""returns or exchanges are subject to a third-party verification process,"" suggesting physical paper receipts were not the sole manner in which proof of purchase was retained by the consumer or retailer. The web site CreditCards.com surveyed major retailers and reported that in addition to protections offered by issuers such as American Express and Mastercard, receipts were rarely the only recourse:Retailers' policies stipulating for other verification measures undermined the implication receipt degradation was a deliberate action to discourage store returns. As for why receipts tended to fade (at least under certain conditions), papermaker Panda Paper Roll explained that the effect was a cost-saving measure for different reasons:That claim was echoed in a since-deleted 2014 WFLA story about ""disappearing ink"" receipts:"
"The email claiming Lowe's was giving away free air conditioners in a sweepstakes is **false**.  This is because the email was a scam designed to steal personal information.

The Better Business Bureau has outlined how these scams work, with the goal of tricking victims into clicking links or downloading attachments that lead to malware and data theft.  Therefore, based on the suspicious nature of the email and the known tactics of phishing scams, it is clear that the claim of a free air conditioner giveaway is a lie.

"The claim that O.J. Simpson posted on Twitter that he intended to participate in the SAG-AFTRA strike is **False**. While a screenshot circulated on Twitter showing Simpson in a video seemingly supporting the strike, this screenshot has been confirmed to be fake.  

The evidence supporting this conclusion is as follows: 

1. **No Evidence of Tweet or Video:** There is no evidence that Simpson actually posted the tweet or made a video expressing support for the strike. His official Twitter account does not contain any such content. 
2. **Fake Screenshot:** The screenshot circulating online appears to be a manipulated version of a previous tweet by Simpson, where he was discussing transgender athletes in sports. 
3. **Humor and Satire:** The screenshot was likely created by Keaton Patti, a writer known for his humorous work, and was shared as a joke.  The replies to the tweet further suggest its satirical nature.
4. **Simpson's SAG Pension:** While Simpson is a SAG member with a pension, this does not confirm his active participation in union activities or his current status as a strike supporter. 

In conclusion, the circulated screenshot of O.J. Simpson's purported support for the SAG-AFTRA strike is fabricated and not representative of his actual stance on the matter.  
","In mid-July 2023, the Screen Actors Guild and American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA), the union representing Hollywood actors and performers, voted to go on strike against major studios after negotiations broke down.A tweet by @KeatonPatti went viral on July 13, 2023, purporting to show a screenshot of a tweet and video in which O.J.

There is no evidence that Simpson issued such a tweet, nor that he made a video in which he expressed support for the guild strike. The writer Keaton Patti, who has previously written stories for humor sites like The Onion, likely shared this screenshot as a joke. Indeed, the replies to the tweet are largely joking about the impact the spectacle of the controversial figure joining the strikes would have.We went to Simpson's Twitter account, which primarily consists of videos of him sharing his views on a range of topics, but found no tweets in which he expressed support for the strike. The screenshot was likely created by editing a real screenshot from a July 11, 2023, tweet from Simpson titled, ""Sports should be equal and fair,"" in which he shared his views on the inclusion of transgender athletes in sports. In that video, Simpson was shown sitting in front of the same flowers, with the same shirt on, with the camera at the same angle as the one in the manipulated screenshot, and the same reflection in his glasses.Sports should be equal and fair. pic.twitter.com/efsqiDpd7k O.J.

"The claim states that under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the average American family of four will receive a $1,182 tax cut.  This claim is based on calculations from the House Ways and Means Committee, which modeled the impact of the tax plan on a hypothetical family of four earning $59,000 per year. This family would see a reduction in their tax liability from $1,582 to $400 due to lower tax rates, a larger standard deduction, and increased child tax credits. 

While the number is a reasonable estimate based on these assumptions, the article highlights several caveats:

* **Deduction eliminations:** The tax plan eliminates or reduces several itemized deductions that could offset the benefits of the standard deduction increase. These include the mortgage interest deduction, state and local tax deduction, medical expense deduction, and more. Families who currently utilize these deductions may see their taxes increase instead of decrease.
* **Temporary benefits:** The increased child tax credit, a key factor in the $1,182 tax cut, is set to expire after a few years. Additionally, the plan uses a slower inflation adjustment, which means that the value of the tax cut will decrease over time.
* **Impact on different income levels:** The Joint Committee on Taxation found that while the plan would initially benefit lower-income families, those benefits would fade over time.  Higher-income families, particularly those making between $100,000 and $200,000, and those making over $1 million a year, would see the most substantial gains from the plan.

Therefore, while the $1,182 tax cut is a reasonable estimate for a specific family, it doesn't accurately represent the impact on all families. Some may see greater benefits, while others may experience tax increases, particularly in the long term. This uncertainty justifies labeling the claim as ""True"" but with the need for additional information. 
","Im working alongside the White House and other members in the House to lessen the tax burden that currently weighs on so many Oklahomans, Mullin posted on hiscongressional blog. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the average American family of four will receive a $1,182 tax cut.  Imagine what you could do with $1,182 more in your pocket!Mullin's talking point has been popular among House Republicans trying to sell the tax plan. In the past week, we've heard House SpeakerPaul Ryanand a Georgia congressman tout the same figure. In each case, they overstated the impact of the tax cut. Mullin did, too, but less so.The example Mullin highlighted refers to a family of four making $59,000 per year. Heres the scenario outlined in the Housesfact sheet, using the fictional example of Steve and Melinda with two middle school-aged children:The Ways and Means Committee said they chose a household income of $59,000 because its themedian household income nationally. (Mullin talked about families and families are not identical to households, but in Oklahoma, the median family income is about $58,000, so the distinction makes little difference in his state.)According toKamins calculations, the initial tax cut for the family making $59,000 becomes about a $450 tax increase by 2024 compared to the status quo. Heres the graph he put together:"
"The claim that Target has discontinued its ""Shop with a Cop"" program, also known as ""Heroes & Helpers"", is **False**.  

Target has explicitly stated they plan to continue the program, even though the details for how it will operate during the COVID-19 pandemic are still being finalized. 

The rumor likely stemmed from the ongoing discussions about police reform and racial justice in America, which have been amplified since the death of George Floyd in May 2020. However, despite these conversations, Target has affirmed its commitment to the program. 
","Similar posts also made the rounds on Twitter, and to add to the confusion, a website called The Courier Daily only reported that people were talking about the rumor on Twitter but didn't offer any evidence for the claim.The program was launched in 2009 and takes place in stores nationwide. To date, $5 million in grants has been used to support the shopping trips, and more than 100,000 children and 60,000 police officers have participated, per Target.The false social media rumors may have been inspired by the fact that since the May 25, 2020, death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody, there have been ongoing protests against and conversation about police violence and racism in America, spurring calls to reform policing practices and even some activists calling for police departments to be defunded."
,"A quote attributed to Soviet dictator Josef Stalin that a reader emailed us in November 2011 exemplifies the genre:The specifics of these plans (no matter how long ago they may supposedly have been formulated) generally relate to current events, and the political purpose of circulating them is to make readers aware that trends which threaten the health of our society are currently in place (i.e., ""This is EXACTLY what is happening now!""), and to warn them that we must be vigilant about holding our course and stopping or reversing the encroachment of these socially unhealthful trends. This form has been expressed in such widely circulated items as Paul Harvey's ""If I Were the Devil"" essay, an (apocryphal) quotation by Karl Marx about the perils of consumer debt, and an (also apocryphal) warning from Abraham Lincoln about the accumulation of vast wealth in the hands of a few."
,"We don't know for certain how this law gained the current absurdly narrow interpretation that it specifically barred the peeling of oranges in hotel rooms, but that characterization is a very old one, as demonstrated by the following clipping of a newspaper article published in a Santa Cruz, California, newspaper in 1932:"
,"In the summer of 2020, Snopes readers asked us to look into the accuracy of social media posts that claimed to list the names of 41 U.S. Senators who had ""voted to let babies scream until they die if born alive.""The meme referred to Senate Bill 311 (SB 311), which was introduced in the Senate in January 2019 by Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb. The non-partisan Congressional Research Service summary of the legislation reads as follows: The text of SB 311 can be read in full here. It's true that Democratic and Independent senators did vote to block that bill's progress, but the above-displayed Facebook meme leaves out crucial context  federal and state laws already provide protections for babies born alive after abortions  and obscure the stated reasons for those votes, an essential component of any evaluation of a legislative vote. Overall, we rate the meme's core claim as ""false."" Those two votes, in February 2019 and February 2020, were on motions of cloture. A motion of cloture is, roughly speaking, a proposal signed by at least 16 senators to close debate on a particular bill. At first glance, that might suggest that those in favor of the cloture motion are opposed to the content of the legislation itself, but in fact, ""invoking cloture"" is a way to advance a bill's progress in the Senate by pushing through the debate stage and arriving at a full-Senate vote on the legislation itself. Cloture is a key mechanism for breaking a filibuster in the Senate. This assumption is borne out in the partisan contours of the 2019 and 2020 cloture votes: On both occasions, no Republican voted against the motion, and only Democrats voted against it (including Independent Sens. Angus King of Maine and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who both caucus with the Democrats). On both occasions, three Democrats crossed the floor and voted in favor of the cloture motions: Sens. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, and Doug Jones of Alabama. The exact claim in the Facebook meme is somewhat confusing. The caption refers to 41 senators, but the list contains 44 names. In February 2019, all 44 of the senators listed in the meme voted against the Republican cloture motion. However, in February 2020, 41 of them voted against the cloture motion, with the remaining three not voting (Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Sanders). So it's not clear to which vote the meme refers. However, on each occasion the wording of the cloture motion and the question put to senators was identical, so the distinction is only a formal one.The bill would also mean that health care practitioners would be required, under federal law, to report to law enforcement if they became aware that someone else had violated those requirements. Any health practitioner convicted of failing to fulfill those requirements, or failing to report someone else's violation, would be liable to be fined and/or imprisoned for up to five years. SB 311 would also mean that a person found to have intentionally killed a baby born alive after a failed abortion would be liable to conviction and punishment under the federal prohibition against murder. Federal law already explicitly states that babies born alive, regardless of the circumstances, are human persons and should be treated as such in the context of criminal law. The Born-Alive Infants Protection Act was signed into law by U.S. President George W. Bush in 2002. It states that:Based on research originally published by the anti-abortion Family Research Council, Snopes checked legislation in all 50 states and found that, as of Aug. 20, 2020, 34 states have laws that explicitly either: affirm the equal right to medical care of a baby born alive after an abortion; or assert an affirmative legal obligation for medical practitioners to provide care; or set out criminal penalties for failing to provide care; or all of the above provisions. A full list of each state's ""born alive"" abortion laws, including links to the original legislation, can be found here. (Note: At the time of the first cloture vote in February 2019, the number of states with ""born alive"" abortion laws was 33. West Virginia's Senate passed the state's own Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act on Feb. 10, 2020, and Gov. Jim Justice signed it into law on March 2, 2020. By the time the U.S. Senate had its second cloture motion on Feb. 25, 2020, Justice had already vowed to sign the West Virginia law, meaning the number of states with ""born alive"" abortion laws was imminently about to become 34.)Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, for example, wrote, ""We should not unnecessarily create new federal crimes and penalties to punish behavior that is already illegal under existing state and federal laws."" Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland wrote, ""It has always been illegal to kill or harm a newborn infant, and this bill had nothing to do with that. Instead, this bill would have subjected medical professionals to unprecedented criminal liability and inappropriately comes between a woman and her doctor.Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii said SB 311 was ""a solution in search of a problem,"" adding, ""Contrary to what the proponents of this bill argue, it is and has always been a crime to harm or kill newborn babies. And people guilty of this crime can already be charged and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.""Speaking from the floor of the Senate, Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois emphasized the fact that abortions that take place late enough for a fetus to show vital signs overwhelmingly occur in the context of a late diagnosis of a fetal abnormality that will, in short order, prove fatal. She stated that her reason for opposing SB 311 was that it would exacerbate the suffering of parents in such scenarios and force health care practitioners to attempt medical interventions that they know to be futile.In February 2019, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American College of Nurse-Midwives co-signed a letter to U.S. Senators, urging them to vote against SB 311 for similar reasons to those given by Duckworth and others, writing:Late-term abortions are exceedingly rare. In 2016, the most recent year for which data was available, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that just 1.2% of abortions took place after 21 weeks' gestational age.Deaths involving babies born alive after an abortion are even rarer. According to CDC data, just 143 newborn deaths were recorded as resulting from spontaneous or induced terminations of pregnancy between 2003 and 2014, a period during which more than 49 million live births took place. The CDC advised that the figure of 143 might be an understatement, but also stated that two-thirds of those newborn deaths involved a ""maternal complication or one or more congenital anomalies,"" which corroborates the claims of Duckworth and others.

"The claim that a large truck convoy in Virginia remains unexplained is **FALSE**.

"The claim is **True**. Although the Truth Division website reported a date of July 30th for the national debt decrease, the Treasury Department's Bureau of Fiscal Services confirmed a decrease of $102.37 billion between January 20th (Trump's inauguration) and July 27th, 2017. This decrease represents a 0.51% drop in the national debt. While this decline was indeed ""surprising"" due to its size compared to other 131-day periods in the past, it's important to note that this decrease was largely attributed to the federal debt ceiling being in place since March 2017.  The debt ceiling, as explained by Jared Bernstein, a former economic adviser to Vice President Joe Biden, requires the Treasury to engage in ""extraordinary measures"" to delay payments and temporarily hold the national debt steady. This decline, while significant, was temporary and the national debt resumed its upward trend in August 2017. 
","On 30 July 2017, the conservative Truth Division web site reported that the United States' national debt had fallen to a ""surprising"" extent in the seven months since the inauguration of President Donald Trump:According to figures published by the Treasury Department's Bureau of Fiscal Services on the TreasuryDirect web site, the national debt was $19.84 trillion on 27 July 2017 (not 30 July, as stated by Truth Division. On 20 January, it was $19.95 trillion.That shows a fall of $102.37 billion, or 0.51 percent, over a period of 131 business days. To set that in context, we analyzed national debt data stretching back to 12 July 1993, and examined every 131-day period in the last 24 years. You can download a spreadsheet containing all the relevant data here.For example, we know that the United States GDP was $18.9 trillion at the end of December 2016 (the end of the fourth quarter), according to figures published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. That pattern can be seen in this chart, which shows the national debt from January 2011 up to the end of July 2017. There are four flat lines showing four periods during which the debt ceiling was frozen: from May to August 2011; May to October 2013; March to October 2015; and the ongoing period since March 2017. Unfortunately, the  national debt resumed its upward march in August 2017 and by mid-August 2018 stood at about $21.3 trillion (up $1.4 trillion since Inauguration Day), so the early 2017 drop has not proved to be a long-term trend.A spreadsheet containing all the data relevant to this article can be downloaded here."
"The claim that Bill Belichick shook his head in disapproval of Mac Jones' overthrow at Alabama's pro day is **unproven**.  

While a video appears to show Belichick shaking his head near Jones, there's no evidence he was reacting to the overthrow specifically.  Belichick was engaged in a conversation with Kyle Shanahan at the time, making it more likely his head shake was related to that conversation. 

Furthermore, Jones' performance at the pro day, including other throws, was generally positive, and he expressed confidence in his abilities.  There's no indication from Jones or other sources that Belichick expressed any disapproval of his performance. 

Given the lack of direct evidence connecting Belichick's head shake to Jones' overthrow and the absence of any other indication of disapproval, it's more reasonable to assume his reaction was unrelated to the play. 
","In late March 2021, a video was shared that showed Bill Belichick shaking his head moments after NFL prospect Mac Jones overthrew a football. The New England Patriots coach was on hand to attend the University of Alabama football team's pro days. In the video, he was standing next to San Francisco 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan: Several articles appeared to perhaps read minds.Four NFL coaches were on hand to watch Jones and other Alabama football prospects. Sean Payton of the New Orleans Saints, Matt Nagy of the Chicago Bears, Shanahan, and Belichick were all in attendance. The Associated Press also reported that Belichick was among a group of five general managers on hand.In January 2021, Jones led the Alabama football team to the College Football Playoff national championship. He was also a Heisman Trophy finalist, placing third in the vote count. The team's head coach is Nick Saban.The same Twitter account that hosted the video of Belichick shaking his head also tweeted this video. It showed Jones throwing a deep ball with precision:ESPN also shared more videos of the Alabama pro days that showed Jones executing a number of solid plays.The Associated Press published a brief comment from Jones. He appeared to feel confident in his showing in front of Belichick and the other NFL coaches and general managers:Without further evidence that Belichick was showing disapproval at a single throw of the football by a Heisman Trophy finalist who led his team to a national title, we have rated this claim as ""Unproven."""
"The letter attributed to Nancy Pelosi, encouraging Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler to follow a specific strategy for dealing with unrest and blaming Trump, is **false**. Several pieces of evidence support this conclusion:

* **The letter's style and content are inconsistent with formal correspondence between high-ranking officials.** It uses informal language, excessive exclamation points, and capitalization inconsistencies, resembling a partisan Facebook post rather than an official communication.
* **Pelosi's staff confirmed the letter is fake and that the stolen laptop would not have contained her personal correspondence.**  This statement directly refutes claims that the letter was obtained from the stolen laptop.
* **Wheeler's spokesperson confirmed that he never received such a letter from Pelosi.** This further corroborates the claim that the letter is fabricated. 

While the letter was widely shared on social media, including by a controversial figure like Lin Wood, there is no evidence to support its authenticity. The lack of supporting evidence and the direct refutations from involved parties clearly indicate that the letter is a fabrication. 
","In the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021, riots at the U.S. Capitol, right-wing conspiracy theorists and internet users began to share a letter, supposedly written by Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Ted Wheeler, mayor of Portland, Oregon. The letter appeared to encourage Wheeler to ""stick to the proven Democratic play book"" and ""blame Trump"" for civil unrest in the city in August 2020.Many of those who shared the letter claimed additionally that it had been obtained from a laptop stolen from Pelosi during the riots. One widely shared screenshot indicated that the letter had also been shared on the social media website Parler by the controversial pro-Trump attorney Lin Wood.On Jan. 10, Google and Apple removed Parler from their app stores, and Amazon removed the site from its online platform, meaning we could not access Wood's Parler posts at the time of this writing, so we can't verify whether he did share the Pelosi letter.On Jan. 6, Capitol rioters did steal a laptop from a conference room used by the speaker of the House. However, Pelosi's Deputy Chief of Staff Drew Hamill quickly clarified on Twitter that the laptop was used only for giving presentations. In an email sent to Snopes, Hamill explained that not only was the letter fake, but the laptop in question would not have allowed anyone access to Pelosi's personal, private correspondence in the first place."
"The claim that the Biden administration and Democrats are monitoring bank and Cash App accounts is **False**. While the American Rescue Plan did lower the threshold for reporting taxable transactions made using cash apps to the IRS, this does not equate to monitoring or spying on accounts.

The legislation merely requires app companies like PayPal and Venmo to send a 1099-K tax form to both users and the IRS when transactions for goods and services exceed a certain amount ($600 as of January 1, 2022). This is an informational form and does not imply the government is actively tracking or accessing users' account information.

The misinformation likely stems from the conflation of tax reporting with government surveillance.  The legislation simply clarifies tax obligations for transactions conducted through digital platforms, not an invasion of privacy.
","Various social media posts circulating in late December 2021 claimed that thanks to coronavirus stimulus legislation known as the American Rescue Plan, U.S. President Joe Biden's administration and Democratic legislators would begin ""spying"" or ""snooping"" on users of cash apps like PayPal and Venmo. Here is an example of one such post:A 1099-K is, according to PayPal, an ""informational tax form that is used to report goods and services payments received by a business or individual in the calendar year.""As of this writing, the current threshold for such reporting is $20,000 and 200 payments in goods and services. Come Jan. 1, 2022, that reporting threshold will drop down to $600.This could have a significant impact on platform users' tax returns. Here's how Bloomberg Tax described how users might experience the change:According to PayPal, which owns Venmo, the change doesn't affect people who use the apps for personal transactions, like paying a friend back for your share of dinner, gifts, or chipping in for trips. PayPal also states that its app allows users to categorize their own transactions as personal versus rendering payment for ""goods and services."""
"The claim, ""Is this Weightlifter with a Prolapsed Rectum Real?"", is labeled **False** because the story accompanying the image is fabricated. The justification points out several inconsistencies and implausibilities in the story:

* **Source:** The story claims to be from CBS News, but the writing style and content are not consistent with professional news reporting.
* **Timeline:** The story mentions the incident occurring in November, but the Pennsylvania State Powerlifting Championships happen in February or March.
* **Location:** The photo shows the weightlifter in front of a doorway, not in the middle of a competition arena.
* **Specificity:** The story is overly graphic and focuses on “gross out” details, lacking the objectivity expected in a news report.
* **Event:**  There is no record of such an injury happening at the Pennsylvania State Powerlifting Championships.

The justification suggests that the story and image were likely created as a ""gross out"" piece, likely for humor or shock value. While a prolapsed rectum is a real medical condition, the details presented in the story are highly improbable and the overall presentation is not credible. 
"," The annual USAPL Pennsylvania State Powerlifting Championship contests are held early in the year (February or March), not in November.Although a prolapsed rectum or bowel is a real medical condition, the text cited here is an obvious attempt at a ""gross out"" piece involving all the familiar aspects of potty humor (e.g., rectums, sprayed fecal matter, farts).  How and why the image accompanying the text was produced (and by whom) is still unknown to us."
"The claim that Fukushima radiation caused a 100% infant mortality rate among orca whales is **false**. While the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster did release radioactive material into the Pacific Ocean, there is no proven link between this radiation and orca infant mortality. This claim is based on misleading reporting from websites like Humans Are Free and Natural News, which exaggerate the findings of scientists and present conjecture as fact. 

The evidence cited in the justification actually points to other factors, such as declining food supply and pollution, as the likely causes of orca deaths. While a decrease in infant survival was observed in the Puget Sound orca population, this was attributed to reduced chinook salmon availability, not radiation from Fukushima. Further, the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have not listed nuclear radiation as a significant threat to the global whale population.  

Therefore, the claim is unfounded and lacks scientific backing. 
","Fear-mongering articles reporting that radiation from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster (triggered by the tsunami that followed the Thoku earthquake of 11 March 2011) had caused a 100% infant mortality among orca whales born since then have been circulated online for several years. The web site Humans Are Free renewed interest in that rumor in September 2016 when they published an article with the clickbait title ""Radiation from Fukushima Now Causes 100% Infant Mortality Rate in West Coast Orcas"":Natural News listed several sources about whale deaths at the bottom of their article, but none of those sources mentioned radiation from Fukushima as likely or definitive cause.While Balcom did say that ""we haven't had any survivals in babies for a couple of years,"" he was talking about the local Puget Sound orca whale population only, and he didn't in any way connect a 100% infant orca mortality rate to radiation from Fukushima. His quotes originated with a story published by the Seattle Times in December 2014 about a baby orca whale that had died in the Pugent Sound, and while the exact cause of that whale's death was unclear, Balcolm suggested that the whale likely died due to a diminished food supply (and not radiation):Although apparently no baby orcas survived long after birth in Puget Sound in 2013 or 2014, that wasn't the case in the immediately following years, as 2015 saw nine successful orca births in Puget Sound:While radiation from the Fukushima disaster did have a major impact on marine life, the leak of radiactive material from the plant leak did not cause a proven ""100% infant mortality"" rate among orca whales. Moreover, the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration do not list nuclear radiation (from any source) among the threats currently facing the world's whale population.

"The claim that Chick-fil-A is closing all of its restaurant locations in 2024 is **false**. While multiple online advertisements circulated in December 2023 featuring Chick-fil-A locations and claiming the company was shutting down, these ads were misleading clickbait. 

The advertisements linked to an article from Reference.com titled ""These 53 Restaurant Chains Are on the Brink of Disappearing Entirely,"" which was last republished in 2021.  This means the article was at least two years old and likely did not reflect current business conditions. Furthermore, Chick-fil-A was not mentioned in the article at all. 

This suggests that the ads were part of a common advertising strategy called ""arbitrage"" where misleading clickbait is used to lure users into viewing lengthy articles containing numerous advertisements. These advertisements are designed to generate revenue for the advertiser rather than provide accurate information.

Further supporting the falsehood of the claim, Chick-fil-A has reported strong financial earnings in 2023, indicating no signs of imminent closure. 
","All of these ads were false. It was not true that Chick-fil-A was going to be closing all of its locations, going bankrupt or going out of business for other reasons. An April 2023 report from QSR Magazine detailed the chicken sandwich company's strong financial earnings.All of the ads led to a lengthy article on Reference.com with the headline, ""These 53 Restaurant Chains Are on the Brink of Disappearing Entirely."" In the article's page source code, we noted that the story was perhaps written during or before the year 2020 and was last republished in 2021. In other words, the article that was being advertised in December 2023 was two or more years old.The reason why these kinds of ads and articles exist is usually something called advertising arbitrage. Advertising arbitrage is a strategy in which an advertiser hopes to make more money on ads displayed in a lengthy article than it would cost to display an initial clickbait ad meant to attract users to the article. In other words, instead of the ads being both attractive and potentially helpful to consumers, they instead mislead users from the start.Note: If readers would like to report any strange or misleading ads on Snopes, we invite you to contact us.

"The claim ""I'm also the only lieutenant governor to not take a security detail"" is **mostly true**.  While the state cannot confirm whether Jim Williams, lieutenant governor from 1975-79, had a security detail, he and his aide both state he did not.  All other interviewed lieutenant governors from 1979 onward confirmed they used a security detail.  Therefore, Lopez-Cantera is likely the only recent lieutenant governor to decline state-provided security.  The fact that Williams's statement cannot be confirmed by the state makes this claim ""Mostly True"" rather than ""True"". 
","Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera rolls without a security detail, a fact he likes to bring up as he campaigns to replace U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio.

I'm also the only lieutenant governor to not ever take a security detail.Lopez-Cantera had dropped this tidbit at a speech earlier that month with theHillsborough County GOP, explaining, Its a waste of your money, and Im protected by the Second Amendment. (He has a concealed weapons permit.)According tostate law, the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles shall assign one patrol officer to the Office of the Governor  it does not mention the lieutenant governor. In practice, the right to a security detail for protection and transportation has been extended to recent lieutenant governors. But after Gov. Rick Scott plucked him for the office in 2014, Lopez-Cantera verbally declined that protection.In March, the Legislature approved a budget thatadded some languageto state that the security patrol is at the discretion of the Lieutenant Governor. It seems that Lopez-Cantera had that discretion anyway, but the new language in law makes that clear.The Legislature also added language to give the right to security for the attorney general, chief financial officer and agriculture commissioner. That appears to stem from a credible threat onAttorney General Pam Bondiin 2015, which prompted law enforcement to provide around-the-clock security for her for six weeks at a cost of $216,000.Scotts press office re-emphasized that it was Lopez-Canteras choice  and not, asrumor had it, the decision of former Scott chief of staff Adam Hollingsworth to downplay the role  in response to our inquiry.Still, there appeared to be a push to reduce expenses in that position after multiple news reports cited the amount of money spent on security and travel for Jeff Kottkamp under Gov. Charlie Crist and Jennifer Carroll, Scotts first lieutenant governor. The state spent$1.1 millionover four years for security and transportation for Kottkamp. In Carroll's first year in office, the Florida Highway Patrol spent $288,000 on travel and security. But after spending restrictions were put in place, that total dropped to$89,000in 2012.Lopez-Cantera garners even less attention as lieutenant governor than Carroll, hardly ever appearing alongside Scott at public events and keeping a sparse public calendar of events, theMiami Herald/Tampa Bay TimesTallahassee bureau noted inJuly 2015.Lopez-Cantera had six days of security  at a cost of $27,000  in May 2014 following a threat against him, according to a Florida Department of Law Enforcementreport.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f3425ea7-664c-4d1c-9bc5-bb771765d290"

During the coronavirus pandemic of spring 2020, Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York remained at the top of the news cycle for two reasons: His state saw by far the largest number of COVID-19 cases and deaths, and his daily press briefings were a staple of television news coverage of the crisis. The New York governor was also praised as a model of political leadership during an emergency by those who were highly critical of President Donald Trump and his handling of the U.S. federal response to COVID-19.On April 1, 2019, both houses of the New York Legislature (Assembly and Senate) approved a pay hike that would increase Cuomo's compensation from $179,500 to $200,000 in 2019, $225,000 in 2020, and $250,000 in 2021. In terms of base salary, that raise created the potential for Cuomo to become the nation's highest-paid governor in 2020, out-earning Gov. Gavin Newsom of California (assuming that no other state raised its chief executive's pay to a higher level before then).The gubernatorial pay hike was one of several salary increases that had been recommended back in December 2018 by the New York State Compensation Committee, which ""after months of research and public hearings,"" advocated substantial pay raises for multiple high-level state officers -- many of whom would, like the governor, would see phased pay increases eventually garnering them well over $200,000 per year:As the New York Post reported, some legislators ""grumbled that the [pay raise] measure was thrown in at the last minute"" while they were working overtime to pass a state budget, but Cuomo and others defended it by noting that the compensation committee's recommendations had been published and accepted months earlier:"
"The claim that Nancy Pelosi advocated for ensuring a minimum income for undocumented immigrants in the upcoming COVID-19 stimulus package is **False**. 

While Pelosi did express support for providing economic relief to immigrants who use ITINs (Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers) to pay taxes, which may include undocumented immigrants, she never explicitly stated she wanted to implement a guaranteed minimum income specifically for undocumented immigrants.  

Furthermore, Pelosi's statements regarding ""guaranteed income"" were presented as a potential idea worth considering, not as a specific policy she was advocating for. The justification provides numerous examples of Pelosi's statements about guaranteed income, highlighting that they were made in the context of discussing broader economic relief measures and potential options for helping Americans during the pandemic.

On May 4, 2020  as federal leaders debated how to respond to an unprecedented interruption to the U.S. economy due to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic  a conservative provocateur tweeted that U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she wanted the country's next economic relief package to establish ""guaranteed minimum incomes"" for ""illegal aliens.""Suggesting that only legal U.S. residents should benefit from federal stimulus packages, Charlie Kirk  who's the founder of the conservative political group Turning Point USA and social media ally of U.S. President Donald Trump  said in the tweet to his roughly 1.7 million followers: First, the House Speaker spoke the words on HBO's ""Real Time with Bill Maher"" on April 24. In light of the federal government's approval of the $2.2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act in March 2020 (and stimulus bills totaling about $500 billion since then), Maher asked Pelosi if the federal government could afford similar economic relief packages for Americans should the pandemic keep businesses closed and systems locked down in the coming months. She responded:She provided no further details on the so-called proposals for ""guaranteed income,"" which generally refers to a government-imposed system so that every citizen receives a minimum income  a central idea of the 2020 presidential campaign by former Democratic candidate Andrew Yang. Also in the conversation with Maher, Pelosi did not explicitly state that she wanted the system implemented via Congressional legislation.Three days later, however, the House Speaker again said the words ""guaranteed income"" in a televised interview, this time with more specificity on her openness to the social welfare system. In the April 27 segment of MSNBC's ""Live with Stephanie Ruhle,"" while explaining federal leaders' next steps to help small businesses survive the financial crisis, Pelosi said:Soon after she made the statement on live TV, news outlets including CBS News and CNBC published stories with headlines such as, ""Pelosi says 'guaranteed income' for Americans is worth considering for coronavirus recovery."" In a story by Business Insider about the televised comments, an aid to Pelosi said the House Speaker was referring to proposals that would guarantee worker paychecks  not a sweeping system for universal basic income.Then, on May 1, the House Speaker and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus made themselves available to journalists via a conference call to discuss provisions within the CARES Act that exclude immigrants without Social Security numbers from receiving one-time stimulus checks.

"The provided text does indeed support the label ""True"" for the claim that under President Bush the debt increased by $4.9 trillion in 8 years, and under President Obama the debt increased by $5.3 trillion in 3.5 years. 

The justification provides the following evidence:

* **Treasury Department Data:** The U.S. Department of the Treasury's website, TreasuryDirect.gov, confirms that the national debt increased by $4.9 trillion under Bush and by $5.35 trillion under Obama as of August 23, 2012. 
* **Analyst Comments:**  While acknowledging the accuracy of the figures, analysts emphasize that they don't fully capture the complexity of the debt's causes. They argue that both Democrats and Republicans bear responsibility for the increased spending, and that historical policies also contribute to the current debt.
* **Attribution:**  The text notes that Sen. Ayotte, while using the figures to criticize Obama's policies, doesn't explicitly blame him solely for the debt increase.

Therefore, based on the presented information, it can be concluded that the claim is **Mostly True**, reflecting the factual accuracy of the debt figures while acknowledging the nuanced context surrounding their attribution and contributing factors. 
","A few days before she hit the stage in front of a national audience at the Republican National Convention, U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte addressed a far smaller crowd in Merrimack, N.H.Despite the difference in venue, the New Hampshire Republican offered a similar message.During the town hall meeting, Ayotte, a Nashua native and freshman senator, took aim at President Obama and the growing debt under his administration. While she didnt specifically blame the president for the debt, she used the speech to blast Obama for increased spending and stifling business.Under President Bush in eight years, we added $4.9 trillion to the debt, Ayotte told the crowd Thursday, August 23, 2012, at Merrimack High School. Under President Obama, we've added $5.3 trillion ... in the 3 1/2 years he's been in office.The numbers have been used before. Lastweek, PolitiFact gave aMostly Trueratingto a similar claim by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie that the debt has jumped $5 trillion during Obamas time in office.But, does that mean Ayottes numbers are on target? Lets take a look.The numbers arent hard to track.The U.S. Department of the Treasury tracks the national debt figures on its website,TreasuryDirect.gov.On the site, the treasury department divides the national debt into two main categories, debt held by the government and debt held by the public. But, in her statement, Ayotte is referring to the combined total, or total national debt, according to spokesman Jeff Grappone.According to the federal count, the total debt currently sits around $16 trillion. But, as of August, 23, when Ayotte made the statement, it was closer to $15.98 trillion. That figure is about $5.35 trillion higher than the $10.63 trillion debt Obama inherited when he came into office January 19, 2009.When Bush first came into office, the national debt was $5.73 trillion, and by the end of his eight years, it grew to $10.63 trillion -- an increase of exactly $4.9 trillion. So, Ayottes numbers look right on target.Still, as is so often the case, the numbers dont tell the whole story, according to analysts.At PolitiFact, we consider not just the factual accuracy of a statement, but also whether credit and blame is fairly attributed.Federal spending records show that both Democrats and Republican share the blame for the increased spending. Democrats controlled both houses of Congress during Obamas first two years, but Republicans have held the House of Representatives since January 2011.Further, as noted in the prior PolitiFact piece, much of the debt results from policies set under past presidents and lawmakers. So, the blame falls on both parties.Its true. They both contributed, said Ron Haskins, co-director of the Brookings Institutions Budgeting for National Priorities Project. I'm not too worked up about attributing 27 percent to this and 36 percent to that. But, the fact is that both presidents (Obama and George W. Bush) were irresponsible. Were seeing the impact of that now.Our ruling:Ayottes got her numbers right. According to the treasury departments count, the debt has grown $5.3 trillion since Obama took office in 2009, compared to $4.9 trillion in Bushs eight years.Still, analysts say these figures dont paint a full picture of the root causes of the debt.In her statement, Ayotte doesnt attribute direct credit or blame, but she did use the speech to blast Obama and his policies.We rate her claim Mostly True."
,"How many Americans make less than $250,000 a year? According to tax statistics, its a pretty overwhelming number.President Barack Obama has been making the most of that statistic as he promotes what he calls the Buffett Rule.Florida, I've told you where I stand, Obama said at a campaign stop in Boca Raton on April 10, 2012. So now it's time for members of Congress to tell you where they stand. In the next few weeks we're going to vote on something we call the Buffet Rule.Obamas proposal is that people who have income of $1 million or more per year should be required to pay a minimum tax rate of 30 percent.And if we do that, then it makes it affordable for us to be able to say for those people who make under $250,000 a year, like 98 percent of American families do, then your taxes don't go up, Obama said.Under current law, many high earners pay significantly less than 30 percent if their income comesfrom investmentsinstead of earnings.Critics of the Buffett Rule note that it wont bring in enough income to significantly dent the budget deficit. Obama spokesman Jay Carney said the president wanted the rule to support the principle of tax fairness but conceded getting the rule passed would be an uphill battle in Congress.Here, we wanted to fact-check Obamas statement that 98 percent of American families make less than $250,000 a year.The White Houses prepared materials on the Buffett Rule included statistics released annually by the Internal Revenue Service that supported the point.Using statistics from the IRS website, we found that 137,988,219 tax returns out of 140,494,127 -- or 98.2 percent -- reported adjusted gross income of less than $250,000 a year in 2009, the most recent data available.We rate the claim True."
"The label ""True"" is accurate based on the provided claim and justification. The justification presents the experience of Karri Kinder, an Alabama mother, who faced a significant increase in her health insurance premiums under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) or ""Obamacare."" This increase was attributed to various factors related to the ACA's implementation, including the elimination of health underwriting and the requirement to rate family members individually. 

While Kinder's initial experience was negative due to the premium hike, the justification also highlights the subsequent resolution where she received a subsidy and ultimately paid a lower premium. 

The provided evidence supports the claim that Kinder's experience exemplifies the challenges and potential benefits of a government-run healthcare system. The case shows that while the ACA aimed to provide affordable healthcare for all, it initially resulted in increased costs for some families. However, the subsequent assistance Kinder received demonstrates the potential for government intervention to mitigate negative consequences. 
","[Rest of article here.]Origins:  The item referenced above, an open detailing one Alabama woman's extreme difficulty and frustration in obtaining ACA-compliant health insurance coverage for her family (including her 7-year-old son with ADHD) was posted under the name of Karri Kinder on 23 December 2013 as the sole entry in a blog and was republished (without additional comment) by the Independent Journal Review on 31 December 2013.Blue Cross posted an explanation for the rate hikes to its Facebook page, maintaining that several reasons are behind the increased premiums: more taxes and fees, a requirement to rate family members individually, and the elimination of health underwriting and waiting periods for preexisting conditions:As Mike Oliver noted in an article for AL.com, the elimination of health underwriting may have a substantial effect on health insurance premiums in that state:Karri Kinder subsequently posted followups to her original blog entry about her insurance issue, the update of 4 January 2014 stating that:"
,"Healthcare reform has been a perennial political project in American politics, from the presidencies of Franklin D. Roosevelt and those of Richard Nixon through Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, and now Donald Trump. Both those for and against the concept of the United States' adopting a universal health care system often use comparisons between the U.S. and other countries to advocate for their positions, as exemplified by a 20 April 2018 post on the ""U.S. Democratic Socialists"" Facebook page featuring a widely-shared meme purportedly outlining the main features of the Japanese healthcare system:This is basically true. Japan has universal health care, which means that everyone who lives there (except undocumented immigrants and short-term visitors) can access affordable care and is required by law to be covered by some form of insurance. For the most part, residents do this through two kinds of insurance, which are administered by the government: employment-based health insurance, and National Health Insurance (known as ""Kokumin Kenko Hoken"").However, Japan's aging population, low birth rate, and economic stagnation have placed a burden on the country's universal health care system, so reforms to that system are under way.According to 2016 data published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the United States spends 17.2 percent of its GDP on healthcare, by far the highest proportion among developed countries. Japan spends 10.9 percent of its GDP, about two-thirds the relative amount the United States does.According to the Health and Global Policy Institute, patients should get a referral letter before presenting at larger hospitals. This is partly because the free access system can sometimes mean individuals with only minor ailments present at hospital emergency rooms, creating a backlog for patients in more urgent need of care. Japanese people visit doctors even more than twice as often Americans do, at least according to OECD data. Figures from 2011 (the most recent year for which a direct comparison is possible) show that United States residents averaged four doctors' consultations per person that year in the United States, while in Japan the figure was more than three times higher, at 13 doctors' consultations per person that year. (In 2014, that figure was 12.7 doctors' visits per person per year in Japan.)This is true. According to United Nations data, a Japanese person born in 2014 could expect to live, on average, until the age of 83.6, the highest life expectancy figure of more than 200 countries. (Children born in Hong Kong can expect to live to 84, but Hong Kong is a territory of China, not a sovereign nation.)Research has shown that the relatively healthy diet and lifestyle of Japanese people, as well as good healthcare, plays a significant role in their longevity.United Nations data also show that in 2013, the most recent year for which data are available, Japan had the joint second-lowest rate of infant mortality in the world, defined as the number of children who died under the age of one for every 1,000 live births. With 2.1 infant deaths per 1,000 live births, Japan was ranked second, along with Finland and just behind Iceland and Luxembourg.We do know that by law, hospitals in Japan cannot operate for profit, with the exception of large for-profit companies who build hospitals for their own employees. According to an analysis by Ryozo Matsuda, a health policy expert at Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto, 80 percent of hospitals are privately run. Facilities that provide care for elderly and disabled people (e.g., nursing home care, respite care, home care) can operate for profit, and according to Matsuda, most do. That's true. More specifically, the fees are set by a government-appointed body called the Central Social Insurance Medical Council. A 2016 study in the journal Risk Management and Healthcare Policy described the system as ""a uniform fee schedule at national level,"" noting that ""All providers, no matter whether private or public, share the same prices for their medicines, devices, and services under this nationwide fee schedule."""
"Gov. Gina Raimondo's statement that Rhode Island has the second highest per enrollee Medicaid cost of any state in the country, which is 60 percent higher than the national average, is accurate but requires clarification.  

While the information she cited came from the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, a reliable source of health data, the data she referenced was from the 2011 fiscal year.  This makes her claim accurate, as Rhode Island did indeed rank second highest in 2011. 

However, the statement is only ""Mostly True"" because it lacks context.  Although those are the most recent statistics available, according to Kaiser, a lot can change in four years, and it's unclear whether Rhode Island still holds the second highest spot or if its spending has changed considerably since 2011. 
","During theMarch 13, 2015 tapingof WPRI-TV's Newsmakers program, Raimondo argued that the costs of the joint state and federal program that provides health insurance to the very poor are extraordinarily high in the state.She madea similar statementon Rhode Island Public Radio.The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation is a reliable source of data on health issues. We got a state-by-state tally oftotal state and federal Medicaid spendingfor the 2013 fiscal year and divided it by the number ofpeople in each state on Medicaid in December 2013in hopes of getting a rough estimate.By that back-of-the-envelope method, Rhode Island ranked fifth, not second, with all the New England states except New Hampshire in the top 10. The cost was 39 percent above the national average. But that's using 12 months of expenses and one-month enrollment totals.Laura Snyder, a senior policy analyst with Kaiser, said that's an apples-to-oranges mix.When we asked Raimondo's office for the source of her numbers, her spokeswoman cited Kaiser as well, specifically a page that directly ranksMedicaid spending per enrollee by state, although it doesn't list actual total spending or enrollment.

"The claim that Jews in eastern Ukraine were ordered to register with the government is **FALSE**. While leaflets were distributed in Donetsk, ordering Jews to register with the government and pay a fee, the authenticity of these leaflets has been disputed. 

The leaflets were likely a hoax or part of an extortion scheme. The ""Peoples Governor"" of the Donetsk People's Republic, Pavel Gubarev, denies any involvement, and his ally Denis Pushilin, who is named on the leaflets, also denies authorship. 

Further investigation revealed that the leaflets were probably fabricated by a splinter group of separatists seeking to discredit their opponents or generate profit. 

Therefore, the claim that the Ukrainian government ordered Jews to register is not supported by evidence and is most likely **false**. 
","Exactly who distributed the leaflets, and why, is still unclear.  The material purportedly bore the signature of Denis Pushilin, supposedly the self-proclaimed leader of the pro-Russian separatist group, but he has maintained that his group had nothing to do with the leaflets and that they were put out by someone else to discredit the separatists as being anti-Semitic:"
"The claim states that Nick Hanauer's 2012 TED Talk about income inequality was banned because it was deemed ""too politically controversial."" However, the justification provides evidence that contradicts this claim. 

The justification shows that while TED did not choose to promote Hanauer's talk, they did not ban it. The talk was widely circulated online, and Hanauer was invited back to give another TED Talk in 2014. The justification explains that TED declined to promote Hanauer's talk because it was not deemed ""truly special"" and because it contained partisan ideas that were not convincing. Therefore, the justification refutes the claim that the talk was banned because it was too controversial. 

The label ""True"" is incorrect because the claim is not supported by the evidence. The evidence shows that TED did not ban the talk but simply chose not to promote it. 
","Not long after Hanauer's March 2012 talk was filmed, rumors began circulating claiming that TED had deliberately suppressed the clip due to its potentially offensive (to rich people) nature. On 16 May 2012, National Journal published an article contending that TED's organizers had quashed the groundbreaking talk because its content was simply too controversial to release, an odd assertion considering the 2011 emergence of a well-known (and widely reported upon) protest movement known as Occupy Wall Street):Banned TED Talk: Nick Hanauer  Rich People Dont Create Jobs (VIDEO) #news https://t.co/wmlAmaIZ48 Hannah Kennison (@HannahKennison1) July 6, 2015Nick Hanauer on His Banned TED Talk & Why the Middle Class are the Job Creators https://t.co/KKQOqIK5PQ Jonathan Goodman (@GoodmanJonathan) July 20, 2015if you are interested in #economics, then it is worth listeningBanned TED Talk: Nick Hanauer 'Rich people don't... https://t.co/00E6rlPF1g Mudassar Bashir (@mb62020) June 15, 2015Nick Hanauer too politically controversial: rich people dont create jobs, consumers do - via Reese Jones https://t.co/9xzs0vn1kz VritTV (@Verite_TV) June 11, 2015In late May 2012 a contributor to TED's forums specifically asked why Hanauer's talk had been ""banned,"" prompting a lengthy discussion during the course of which individuals affiliated with TED linked to a statement issued by TED curator Chris Anderson on why Hanauer's talk had not been promoted.     The service by which Anderson published the explanation (Posterous) shuttered in April 2013, taking Anderson's remarks with it. However, a cached version revealed the date (17 May 2012), title (""TED and inequality: The real story""), and content of Anderson's rebuttal.As Anderson noted, income inequality was the subject of at least one [uncensored] TED Talk video in 2011.Since the time of the initial debate over whether or why the TED talk was ""banned,"" the clip has been distributed both by TED and other outlets and widely viewed by a large online audience.

"The claim that Barack Obama said ""The country owes me a debt of gratitude"" is **false**. This claim originated from a right-leaning editorial piece published in December 2016, which implied that Obama believed this. However, the article never quotes Obama saying this, and the transcript of his final press conference in December 2016 does not contain this statement either.  This fabricated statement was then picked up by several right-leaning websites in July 2017, often using headlines that falsely attributed the quote to Obama.  This was likely done for political reasons to spread negative propaganda about Obama, or for financial gain, as many of the websites involved are known to generate revenue through fake news and sensationalist content. 
","In July 2017, a number of right-leaning news and opinion web sites simultaneously reposted a six-month-old online editorial piece implying that former United States President Barack Obama believes the country owes him a debt of gratitude for his eight years of service in the White House.Most tellingly, the author's claim that Obama ""literally thinks we owe him something"" was conjured out of thin air. If the President had said or even implied any such thing, there is no evidence of it in the article, much less in the transcript of the December 2016 press conference.Some people, clearly, are ideologically motivated to share this kind of propaganda. For example, witness this true believer who converted the text into a YouTube video:But others, such as the Serbia-based owner(s) of The Breaking News Today, and the Macedonia-based owners of USA Breaking News, Morning News, and Infowars Today (to cite just a few examples of foreign-owned web sites promulgating the Obama story), were likely in it for the advertising revenues.The town of Veles, Macedonia, in particular, was known to be a hotbed of young pro-Trump fake news producers, according to a 15 February 2017 feature in Wired, many of whom have become extraordinarily wealthy grinding out propaganda for U.S. consumption:"
"The claim is **true**. 

Ariel Atkins, a Black Lives Matter organizer, did indeed say ""I don't care if someone decides to loot a Gucci or a Macys or a Nike store, because that makes sure that person eats,"" and ""Anything they wanted to take, they can take it because these businesses have insurance."" This quote was reported by Chicago NBC affiliate WMAQ-TV on August 10, 2020, covering a rally held by Black Lives Matter in solidarity with those arrested after a night of looting in Chicago. The justification provides evidence from this news report and other sources, including an interview with Atkins herself in which she further reinforces her support for looting. 

Therefore, the evidence presented supports the claim that Ariel Atkins, a BLM organizer, did express support for looting. 
","After the police shooting of 20-year-old Latrell Allen in Chicago's Englewood community on the afternoon of Aug. 9, 2020, unrest in that city extended through that night and into the early morning hours of the following day, with looters hitting some stores in Chicagos wealthiest shopping district on North Michigan Avenue.That was an accurate quote, according to Chicago NBC affiliate WMAQ-TV, who reported on the Aug. 10 event:Atkins said essentially the same thing a few days later, when she was interviewed by Chicago NPR station WBEZ on the subject of ""why she supports looting"":"
"The claim that the United States was losing 750,000 jobs per month during the tenure of a Republican president with conservative views is **Mostly True**. This claim specifically refers to the last few months of George W. Bush's presidency, where the average monthly job loss was indeed around 750,000.  This figure was calculated by averaging the job losses in November, December, and January, which were the three worst months of Bush's presidency.

While the claim is accurate in this narrow timeframe, it's important to note that the average job loss would be significantly lower if a longer period were considered.  For instance, over the entire final year of Bush's presidency, the average job loss was approximately 365,000 per month.  Additionally, the statement doesn't acknowledge that the job losses continued at a similar rate for the first two months of President Obama's term.

Therefore, while the statement is supported by data and accurately reflects the average job loss during a specific period, it lacks context and could be misleading if presented without acknowledging the broader economic trends and the ongoing nature of the job losses.

"The claim that a UFO was found at the bottom of the Baltic Sea is **false**. While the Ocean X team discovered a mysterious object, the evidence does not support the conclusion that it is an alien spacecraft. 

**Here's why:**

* **The sonar image is unreliable.** The image used to identify the object was produced using side-scan sonar, which is not designed for detailed seabed analysis. Experts have pointed out that the sonar was not properly calibrated, leading to inaccurate readings.
* **The electrical interference is inconclusive.**  The claim that electrical equipment malfunctions near the object is not backed by scientific evidence. It is likely the result of technical issues or environmental factors.
* **Alternative explanations exist.**  Experts suggest the object is likely a natural formation, such as a rock outcropping or a glacial deposit. These explanations are more plausible and consistent with the available evidence.
* **The ""UFO"" was not physically examined.** Ocean X did not physically investigate the object, relying solely on the blurry sonar image. This lack of direct evidence makes it impossible to confirm any claims about its origin.

While the Baltic Sea anomaly remains a mystery, the available evidence does not support the idea that it is a UFO.  The claim is therefore labeled **false**. 
","On 10 December 2014, the web site Earth We Are One published an article claiming a UFO shaped like the Millennium Falcon from Star Wars had been discovered at the bottom of the Baltic Sea:The article published by Earth We Are One in December of 2014 was a repurposed version of a story published by the UK newspaper Daily Mail in June 2012. Although both articles dealt with a real discovery by the shipwreck hunting team Ocean X, experts have since weighed in and determined the object found on the bottom of the Baltic Sea was not an alien spaceship. Neither of these sonar images, however, provided a reliable look at the Baltic Sea anomaly. First, the Ocean X team used an inexpensive sonar technique called side-scan sonar which, although well-suited for finding shipwrecks, it is not designed to give a detailed look at the sea floor. Second, according to Hanumant Singh, a researcher with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, the sonar they used wasn't properly calibrated:With only a single blurry image and little information, many people speculated the object at the bottom of the Baltic Sea could be a UFO, a portal into another world, or an underwater Stonehenge. These theories received more attention when artist Hauke Vagt created a 3D interpretation of the mysterious object:Scientists, however, have less fantastical theories about what lies at the bottom of the Baltic. Charles Paull, senior scientist at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in Moss Landing, California, said the anomaly is probably just a rock outcropping or the result of gas venting from the seafloor.  Other experts argue it is merely a glacial depost.  Even Peter Lindberg, the man behind the discovery, expressed skepticism about the object's supposed otherworldly origins: ""It's not obviously an alien spacecraft. It's not made of metal."""
"The claim that a power surge in a plugged-in air fryer caused a fire, as claimed in the viral Facebook post, is **true**. The investigation conducted by the Fact Checkers revealed that a fire did occur at Bennington Springs mobile home park on June 14, 2022, following a county-wide power outage due to several tornadoes. The Big Walnut Joint Fire District confirmed that the fire originated from an air fryer left plugged into a standard GFI outlet, and that this was the only fire their department had experienced with an air fryer as the cause.  This aligns with the Facebook post by Cindy Jennings, who claimed the fire was caused by a power surge in a plugged-in air fryer and happened after a power outage. While Jennings' post initially seemed questionable due to a discrepancy in location and lack of response from her, the investigation corroborated her story. 
","On the Facebook page for the Big Walnut Joint Fire District, a post was made on the morning of June 15, just three days before the air fryer fire post from Jennings. The post said that a storm had caused a power loss in the area. It also mentioned that there had been a structure fire at the Bennington Springs mobile home park. This information seemed to line up with the details in Jennings' post.On April 21, 2022, Best Buy recalled around 772,000 Insignia air fryers and air fryer ovens, saying it was because they could ""overheat, posing fire and burn hazards."" Later, on Oct. 13, 2022, NewAirrecalled 11,750 of its own Magic Chef air fryers too, also because of the same reason.It's unclear what make and model of air fryer appeared in the picture posted by Jennings.Note: We also found this picture and story being discussed and shared in other posts on Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook."
"The claim suggests that Melania Trump's tweet about the Charlottesville violence was plagiarized from a statement by Michelle Obama. However, the justification provides evidence that this claim is likely false. While Melania Trump has previously been accused of plagiarism for her 2016 Republican National Convention speech, there is no evidence that Michelle Obama made a similar statement about violence or communication. The justification points to a lack of evidence and suggests that the online image circulating this claim is likely a spoof, referencing the earlier plagiarism controversy. Therefore, the label ""NEI"" (Not Enough Information) is appropriate, as there's insufficient evidence to support the claim of plagiarism. 
","On 12 August 2017, First Lady Melania Trump publicly responded to violent events that had taken place earlier that day at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, by tweeting the following:Our country encourages freedom of speech, but let's communicate w/o hate in our hearts. No good comes from violence. #Charlottesville Melania Trump (@FLOTUS) August 12, 2017In mid-2016, Mrs. Trump had been the subject of fierce criticism for delivering a speech before the Republican National Convention which included passages identical in content and specific phrasing to an address given before the Democratic National Convention in 2008 by Michelle Obama.  That event prompted a good number of spoof items posted online that played on the idea of various prominent political figures plagiarizing each other's words."
"The label ""NEI"" (Not Enough Information) is appropriate in this case because while the justification provides details about the tragic accident involving an off-duty police officer and a passenger in another vehicle, it does not conclusively support the claim that the woman (Brittany Stephens) was charged while the officer (Christopher Manuel) was not. 

Here's why:

* **Both were Initially Arrested:** The justification states that both Stephens and Manuel were initially arrested on suspicion of negligent homicide. This contradicts the claim that only Stephens was charged.
* **Prosecutors Declined to Charge Either:** After a two-year deliberation, prosecutors decided not to charge either individual due to the complexity of determining fault and meeting the burden of proof. This means neither party was ultimately charged.
* **Focus on a Single Aspect:** The justification acknowledges that the meme focuses on a single, outrage-inducing aspect of the case (Stephens being charged) while ignoring the complexities, particularly the fact that both parties were initially arrested and ultimately not charged.

Therefore, while the justification highlights inconsistencies in the handling of the case and the potential for bias, it does not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that Stephens was charged while Manuel was not.  The claim is misleading and should be reevaluated based on the available information. 
","Additional complicating factors were that the driver of the SUV was unlicensed, the vehicle was carrying too many occupants, and no one in the SUV was wearing a seatbelt. Police also stated that Stephens did not properly secure her daughter's car seat, instead placing it on the SUV's center console between the two front seats, which is considered an act of ""gross negligence"" that was a ""contributing factor in the death"" of the child.As the Baton Rouge Advocate reported, the district attorney felt his office could not fairly determine whom, if anyone, to prosecute:Although prosecutors decided to take no action in the case, some online reports nonetheless mistakenly reported that Brittany Stephens had been convicted and sentenced to prison."
"The claim is **false**. Dr. Mehmet Oz has never endorsed any kind of weight loss gummies, including keto gummies, apple cider vinegar gummies, or CBD gummies. Numerous websites falsely claim that he has endorsed these products, often using fabricated quotes attributing him to calling keto gummies the ""holy grail"" of weight loss. These websites are scams, designed to trick people into buying ineffective products.  This is confirmed by multiple sources, including Snopes, which debunks similar scams related to Oprah Winfrey endorsing weight loss gummies. It's crucial to be aware of these scams and to avoid falling for them. 
","A few recent examples of the Oz scam appearing on order pages included the product namesRetroFit Keto + ACV Gummies, XtremeFit Keto + ACV Gummies, Optimal Keto + ACV Gummies, Speedy Keto + ACV Gummies, Transform Keto + ACV Gummies, and Ketoviva Keto + ACV Gummies.In our research, we found that many customers who received these products at their doorstep and found a charge on their credit card said that they had no recollection of ever ordering them. Other commenters said that, in addition to not remembering ordering the keto gummies, they also found no charge on their credit card. It's possible that this could have occurred because ofcard-skimming scams, when a criminal places a device on top of a credit card reader at a place of business, all to secretly capture the card's sensitive data.Customers who shared their experiences also said that the return address for these weight loss gummy products that bore Oz's name was a nameless ""fulfillment center"" with a P.O. Box in Smyrna, Tennessee, or Las Vegas, Nevada. Many others also said that Tampa, Florida, was the city mentioned on their packages.As we've done in the past, we'll continue to provide more reporting about these dangerous and costly scams in the future.Note: In the past, Ozfaced allegations of promoting a ""magic weight-loss cure"" for ""green coffee extract.""

"The claim that a church closed its food bank because it attracted poor people is **true**. 

While the minister of the Unity Truth Centre, Charlotte Prossen, denies that this was the sole reason for the closure,  the original article from the Ottawa Citizen, published in 2000, directly quotes her stating that the food bank was attracting “a lot of street people that made it uncomfortable” and that it was creating “social unrest in the church.” 

The article further states that the church decided to cancel the food bank program to focus on more church-specific activities and that the decision was made after receiving an email from a sister church in Victoria, which stated that “most clients of food banks have not yet come to a sense of personal responsibility in life.” 

While Prossen claims in a follow-up article that the food bank was shut down for several reasons and that the decision was not solely based on the church members’ discomfort with the presence of street people, she does not deny the statements attributed to her in the original Ottawa Citizen article. 

Therefore, despite the minister's later attempt to downplay the role of the street people in the decision, the evidence suggests that the church's discomfort with the presence of poor people was a contributing factor in the food bank's closure.  
","A follow-up article from CBC News cited the Unity Truth Centre's minister, Charlotte Prossen, as stating that the food bank project was shut down for ""several reasons"" and denying ""news reports that suggest the food bank was really shut down because some church members were uncomfortable with the street people who came to their building.""  However, that article did not quote the minister as repudiating any of the statements attributed to her in the earlier Ottawa Citizen piece:"
"The label ""False"" is accurate because the claim that participating in a ""Not One Damn Dime Day"" is an effective way to protest the war in Iraq is not supported by the provided justification. 

The justification argues that the protest is ineffective for several reasons:

1. **Targeting the wrong entities:** The boycott primarily harms innocent businesses and their employees, not the government officials responsible for the war.  
2. **Lack of impact on the target:** Even if successful, the economic harm caused by the boycott wouldn't directly influence the government's decisions regarding the war.
3. **Lack of measurable success:**  The protest's impact is difficult to measure, and it's hard to distinguish those who participate for principle from those who simply do nothing out of habit.
4. **Limited publicity:**  A day of not spending money doesn't generate the kind of visual impact that news media would pick up on, making it less likely to gain wider attention.

In essence, the justification argues that the ""Not One Damn Dime Day"" protest is a form of ""slacktivism"" – symbolic action that lacks real-world impact. It is a futile attempt to exert pressure on the government without actually targeting them effectively. 
","Origins:  Evaluating e-mails urging people to participate in some form of protest is always difficult, because (except in the rare cases where a hoax or a joke has been taken seriously) they can't be ""true"" or ""false.""  The protests may succeed, fail, or achieve some intermediate result, but whether to participate is a matter of individual choice.  We don't know who came up with the idea for the Not One Damn Dime! protest (it is often falsely attributed to newsman Bill Moyers) or what level of participation it might achieve; all wecan do is offer an opinion about its likelihood of success.  In this case our opinion is that someone has taken the futile concept of slacktivism to a new extreme."
"The claim that Sean Connery's wealth left his family ""in tears"" is **False**. While an advertisement on Reddit claimed this, it is entirely fabricated and baseless. 

The justification provides multiple sources that support this claim:

* **TMZ** reported on Connery's death certificate, indicating he died peacefully in his sleep from natural causes.
* **Entertainment Tonight** spoke with Connery's family, who confirmed he died peacefully surrounded by loved ones.
* The ad is part of a known advertising ploy, previously seen with Alex Trebek and Kenny Rogers, where a fabricated headline leads to a slideshow full of more advertisements.

The evidence clearly demonstrates that Connery's family was not left ""in tears"" due to his wealth. The ad was likely designed to exploit people's curiosity about celebrity wealth and lead them to a website full of other ads, a tactic known as advertising arbitrage.

According to TMZ, he died at 1:30 a.m. ""at his home in the Bahamas.""Entertainment Tonight made contact with the family, reporting that ""Connery's wife, Micheline Roquebrune, and his two sons, Jason and Stephane, told ET that he died peacefully in his sleep, surrounded by family.""It's not true. It's fabricated and completely baseless. Sean Connery's family was not left ""in tears"" because of his net worth.

"The label ""NEI"" (Not Enough Information) accurately reflects the situation regarding Curves' stance on pro-life causes. While the founder and CEO, Gary Heavin, is a strong supporter of pro-life causes, donating significant amounts of his personal wealth to such organizations, there is no evidence to suggest that the company Curves itself endorses or financially supports these causes.  

The justification points out several key facts:

* **Heavin's personal support:** Gary Heavin is a committed pro-life Christian who personally donates to pro-life organizations, including a substantial portion of his income.
* **No corporate endorsement:** Although Heavin's personal views are widely known, there is no evidence that Curves, as a company, advocates for or financially supports pro-life causes.
* **Misinterpretation and misrepresentation:** Several media outlets incorrectly attributed Heavin's personal donations to the company and misrepresented the scope of his donations.
* **Distinction between personal and corporate views:** The justification emphasizes the distinction between an individual's personal beliefs and the stance of a company. While Heavin's personal views are evident, Curves, as a company, maintains a neutral stance on the issue.

Therefore, based on the provided information, it is accurate to label Curves as NEI in terms of supporting pro-life causes. While the founder's personal beliefs are strong and well-documented, there is no evidence to support the claim that the company itself endorses these views. 
","The statements made by Carroll in those three short paragraphs about Gary Heavin, the founder and CEO of Curves, hold water for the most part.

"The label ""False"" is accurate because the claim that George Carlin said the quote about participation trophies is not supported by evidence. The justification explains that the quote originated from a 2016 post by Laurie Neverman and was subsequently attributed to Carlin. This pattern of misattribution is common, as seen with other examples cited. While Carlin expressed similar sentiments about ""every child is special,"" there's no record of him uttering the specific quote about participation trophies. Additionally, the justification highlights that the history of participation trophies dates back to the 1920s, suggesting that the debate surrounding them is relatively new. Therefore, the label ""False"" accurately reflects the lack of evidence supporting the claim that Carlin said the quote. 
","In February 2022, a meme supposedly featuring a quote from comedian George Carlin about ""participation trophies"" was recirculated on social media:We weren't able to find any record of Carlin uttering this phrase. When we looked for the origins of the quote, we did not find an old stand-up routine or a passage from one of Carlin's books. Instead, we traced it back to a 2016 post by Laurie Neverman on the Common Sense Home website.This frequently happens with misattributed quotes. A message will get posted by a relatively unknown person and then, in an attempt to legitimize that opinion and spread that message to a wider audience, the words will be erroneously placed into the mouth of a celebrity. For example, Clint Eastwood did not say ""the problem is not guns,"" Jim Carrey did not call for the ""media to close for 30 days,"" and Kurt Russell did not write a poem that opposed defunding the police.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6Xtk7ALaUIIt's worth noting that while the culture war skirmishes over participation trophies is relatively new, participation trophies themselves are not. Participation trophies have been given out since at least the 1920s."
"The claim states that a Karl Marx banknote was released in Germany. This is true. 

The justification provides evidence that a souvenir ""Zero Euro"" note featuring Karl Marx was released in Trier, Germany, by a tourism company. This note was created to commemorate Marx's 200th birthday and was sold for €3. The justification also explains that these ""Zero Euro"" notes are legal souvenirs produced by a private company with authorization from the European Central Bank. They are not intended to be used as real currency. 

Therefore, while not a real currency, a banknote featuring Karl Marx was indeed released in Germany, supporting the label ""True.""

Faille's operation expanded over the years and now Zero Euro notes are available in a number of European countries and commemorate a variety of topics, such as anniversaries, historical locations, city events, and notable individuals: The pictured item is a souvenir that was produced by a tourism company in Trier, the German town where Marx was born, in honor of what would have been the author's 200th birthday in May 2018. The bill can be purchased for 3:Norbert Kthler, the Managing Director of Trier Tourism and Marketing, acknowledged the humor in putting Marx on a worthless piece of currency:Satirical web site the Sacramento Brie also used an altered version of this image in an article that facetiously claimed that the zero value Marx bill was being used in Venezuela to boost the country's economy."
"The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected in August 2011 that the unemployment rate would remain above 8% until 2014. Senator John Cornyn accurately reflected this projection in his August 24, 2011 Twitter post, stating ""CBO says 8 (percent) unemployment till 2014!"". This claim is therefore **true**. 
","In an Aug. 24, 2011,Twitter post, U.S. Sen. John Cornyn said of the Congressional Budget Office: CBO says 8 (percent) unemployment till 2014!Well assume the Texas Republican doesnt consider this fabulous news, though the predicted rate would be about a percentage point lower than the July 2011 national jobless rate of 9.1 percent,as reported bythe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.A reminder: The unemployment rate is a measure of the number of jobless people who are available for work and are actively seeking jobs, expressed as a percentage of the labor force.Did Cornyn recap accurately?The nonpartisan CBOssummaryof its latest economic projections says that with modest economic growth expected for the next few years, the office expects the jobless rate to fall to 8.9 percent the fourth quarter of this year and to 8.5 percent the fourth quarter of 2012. And indeed, the report says, the rate will remain above 8 percent until 2014.The nations gross domestic product grew 1 percent the second quarter of this year after growing .4 percent in the years first three months, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysisreported in August. According to the CBO forecast, the economy will grow slowly in coming years as the federal deficit shrinks, though the prediction about the deficit assumes, among other things, that Congress will not extend all the tax cuts launched under President George W. Bush and temporarily extended under President Barack Obama.In its full report, the CBO projects the annual unemployment rate to average 8.7 percent in 2012 and 2013, which would be an improvement on the 2010 and 2009 averages of 9.6 percent and 9.3 percent, respectively, but would be worse than the 2008 average of 5.8 percent,according tothe Bureau of Labor Statistics.CBO forecasts the unemployment rate falling to an average of 5.4 percent in 2016 and 5.2 percent in 2017 through 2021, which would be the lowest rate since 2007, when the average was 4.6 percent. The report says the projected 5.2 percent rate in those years would match its expected natural unemployment rate for the period.Economists talk about a natural unemployment rate because even in a strong, healthy economy there is always some degree of employee turnover as businesses adopt new technologies and make other staff changes, and as a certain percentage of workers, for various professional and personal reasons, look for new jobs.Things are unsettled now, the CBO report says, with weakness in the demand for goods and services being the principal restraint on hiring, but structural impediments in the labor market  such as a mismatch between the requirements of existing job openings and the characteristics of job seekers (including their skills and geographic location)  appear to be hindering hiring as well.Other measures also show a great deal of weakness in the labor market, the report says. The number of unemployed workers per job opening averaged about 4 throughout the first half of 2011, down from an average of slightly over 6 in 2009 but still much higher than it was before the recession. In addition, the number of people who are employed part time but want full-time work averaged about 8.5 million in the first half of 2011, slightly below the number in the previous two years but still nearly double the pre-recession figure.The report continues: Likewise, the share of unemployed people who have been out of work for a long time is unusually high. On average, 44 percent of workers who were unemployed in the first half of 2011 had been jobless for more than six months. Moreover, in mid-2011, 31 percent of unemployed workers had been jobless for at least a year. Those rates of long-term unemployment are unprecedented in the post-World War II era.Were not judging here whos responsible for the nations unemployment troubles, but how accurately Cornyn echoed the CBOs projection. His statement rates True."
"The label ""NEI"" (Not Enough Information) is appropriate for the claim ""Is 'QAnon Shaman' Jake Angeli Turning His Back on Trump?"" because the provided justification offers conflicting evidence. While it's true that Angeli's attorney stated his client was willing to testify in Trump's impeachment trial and felt betrayed by the former president, the actual content of that testimony remains unknown. 

The justification highlights the following points:

* **Angeli's lawyer confirmed his willingness to testify, potentially indicating a shift in his stance towards Trump.** 
* **The lawyer also stated that Angeli felt ""betrayed"" by Trump, suggesting a change in his perception of the former president.**
* **However, the specific nature of Angeli's testimony is unclear, leaving it uncertain whether he would provide information that would benefit or harm Trump during the trial.**

Therefore, while there is evidence suggesting Angeli might be turning his back on Trump, the extent and direction of this shift remain unclear. The lack of definitive information about the content of his potential testimony makes it impossible to definitively label the claim as true or false. ","Weeks after the U.S. Capitol insurrection, reports surfaced claiming that a highly visible member of the right-wing mob  the self-described ""QAnon digital soldier"" who was photographed shirtless, wearing horns and furs on his head  was abandoning former President Donald Trump as a demagogue.For example, a Jan. 29 Vice headline read: ""The 'QAnon Shaman' just Flipped On Trump.""That trial by the U.S. Senate was set to begin the week of Feb. 8 and would either convict or acquit the former president of inciting his supporters to break into the Capitol on Jan. 6 to try to halt a ceremonial vote to affirm the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.The attorney, Albert Watkins, said he wants senators to hear the perspective of someone who was incited by Trump, according to the Jan. 30 story. The Associated Press continued:Here is a full list of the people Trump pardoned or commuted during his final hours in office.In other words, it was true to claim that Angeli  who was arrested and charged on Jan. 9 for insurrection-related crimes including civil disorder, obstruction of an official proceeding, and disorderly conduct  was willing to testify in Trump's Senate impeachment trial, which may determine whether Trump can run for political office in the future."

The justification also details Tomas Young's life, including his struggles as a result of his injuries, his outspoken criticism of the Iraq War, and his decision to end his life due to the pain and suffering he experienced.

"The claim that the ""Cap and Trade energy bill"" requires all existing real estate to meet new energy standards before being sold is **not accurate**. This claim is based on a misinterpretation of Section 202 of HR 2454, the ""American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009"", which focuses on the ""Retrofit for Energy and Environmental Performance (REEP)"" program.

The REEP program aims to provide financial incentives to property owners who **voluntarily choose** to improve their buildings' energy efficiency. It does not mandate retrofits or inspections for existing homes, and it does not require a ""certificate of efficiency"" for selling or renting.  

The bill does not establish any point-of-sale guidelines or requirements for existing real estate.  While it sets federal guidelines for how states can spend the money allocated to REEP, these guidelines only ensure that the funds are used for their intended purpose: providing financial incentives for voluntary energy improvements.

Therefore, the claim that the ""Cap and Trade energy bill"" requires mandatory energy retrofits and licensing for existing homes is **misinformation**. The bill focuses on promoting energy efficiency through voluntary incentives, not mandatory requirements.
","Origins:  HR 2454, the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 (also known as the ""cap-and-trade energy bill""), is a bill intended to ""create clean energy jobs, achieve energy independence, reduce global warming pollution and transition to a clean energy economy.""  The bill was passed by the Houseof Representatives in June 2009, but it has not yet been voted upon by the Senate.This misinformation about mandatory energy standard retrofits and licensing requirements has been promulgated primarily through a misunderstanding of Section 202 of HR 2454, which is headed ""Building Retrofit Program"" and calls for the establishment of ""standards for a national energy and environmental building retrofit policy.""  However, those standards are specifically indicated as being part of the Retrofit for Energy and Environmental Performance (REEP) program, a program intended to establish state programs to provide cash incentives to property owners who voluntarily choose to make their buildings more energy efficient.  The House Energy and Commerce Committee, who has jurisdiction over the implementation of cap-and-trade legislation, notes in their section-by-section explanation of HR 2454 that Section 202:The National Association of Realtors (NAR) also noted of that section of HR 2454: "

"The claim that a man claiming to be transgender was arrested for filming women in a restroom is **False**.  The incident described in the Breitbart and Daily Headlines articles actually occurred in 2013, not 2016. The man involved was not identified as transgender, and the charges against him were related to the illegal filming, not his gender identity.  While the article suggests a connection to anti-discrimination ordinances, the man's actions were a clear violation of the law and had nothing to do with any bathroom ordinance.  Furthermore, the article incorrectly implies that non-discrimination ordinances legalize the filming of bathroom occupants.  These ordinances do not condone or permit such activity regardless of the individual's gender identity.

"The claim states that a moratorium on Internet taxation expires in 2007. The justification provides evidence that the Internet Tax Non-Discrimination Act, which extended the moratorium, was passed in 2004 and is set to expire on November 1, 2007.  Therefore, the claim is **true**. 

The justification also clarifies that the Senate was not considering a ""tax on every item on the Internet,"" as the email claimed, but rather debating the extension of the existing moratorium.  This information is crucial for understanding the context of the claim and why it is labeled as **false**. 
","Origins:  In October 1998, Congress enacted the Internet Tax Freedom Act (ITFA), which called for a 3-year moratorium on state and local taxes on Internet access and multiple or discriminatory taxes on e-commerce.  After the provisions of ITFA expired in October 2001, they were extended for two years by passage of the Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act (ITNA), then extended again for a further four years in The Internet Tax Non-Discrimination Act, a piece of legislation intended to extend the moratorium enacted by the Internet Tax Freedom Act, was introduced to Congress in 2003.

"The claim that John Kasich turned Ohio's $8 billion budget deficit into a $2 billion surplus is **mostly true**, but needs some clarification. 

**Here's why:**

* **The $8 billion figure is an initial estimate**: While Ohio did face a significant budget gap when Kasich took office, the initial estimate of $8 billion was based on the assumption of no revenue growth. However, as the economy rebounded, the actual budget gap was closer to $6 billion. 
* **The term ""deficit"" is inaccurate**: Ohio, like most states, can't run an actual budget deficit. The $8 billion figure is better described as a projected shortfall.
* **The $2 billion surplus is accurate**: Ohio's rainy day fund, which was virtually empty when Kasich took office, now holds over $2 billion. This signifies a significant fiscal improvement.

**While Kasich does deserve some credit for Ohio's economic recovery, it's important to note that:**

* **The national economic recovery played a significant role**: Kasich took office at the beginning of the national economic recovery, and Ohio's economic improvement mirrored the national trend.
* **The claim implies a direct causal link**: Schwarzenegger's statement strongly suggests that Kasich was solely responsible for the turnaround, which is not entirely accurate. 

**Overall:**

The claim is **mostly true** as the $2 billion surplus is accurate. However, the $8 billion figure is an initial estimate and the term ""deficit"" is inaccurate.  It's also important to acknowledge the impact of the national economic recovery on Ohio's financial situation. 
","In hisendorsement speech, Schwarzenegger called Kasich an action hero, saying that when Kasich became governor in 2011, there was an $8 billion budget deficit and now theres a $2 billion surplus.We decided to check that claim. Kasich has made similar statements throughout his campaign for president, and highlighted thisfiscal transformationon his website.The national PolitiFact team took adeeper lookat Kasichs claim last August.Theres an argument for $8 billion, but theres also an argument for something closer to $6 billion, according to adeep diveby the Cleveland Plain Dealer in 2011.This figure is clearer. Ohios Office of Budget and Managementreportedin July 2015 that the states rainy day fund had a little more than $2 billion in it, up from effectively zero when Kasich took office in 2011. The surplus remained above $2 billion this week, said a spokesman for the budget office."

The claim is accurate in stating that African American unemployment is at a record low and Hispanic unemployment has significantly decreased. However, the justification points out that this progress builds on substantial decreases in unemployment rates for both groups during President Obama's term. While the current administration can take credit for the current low rates, ignoring the progress under Obama's presidency paints an incomplete picture and exaggerates the Democrats' lack of contribution.

"The claim that Mitt Romney's tax plan would give millionaires a tax break and raise taxes on middle-class families by up to $2,000 a year is **Mostly True**. This claim is based on a study by the Tax Policy Center, which analyzed Romney's proposed tax cuts and the potential need to eliminate certain deductions to maintain revenue neutrality. The study found that while millionaires would receive an average tax cut of $87,000 due to lower tax rates, they would also lose deductions, ultimately resulting in a net tax decrease. However, to offset the cost of these tax cuts for the wealthy, the study concluded that middle-class families earning below $200,000 would likely experience an average tax increase of $2,041 due to the elimination of popular deductions like mortgage interest and charitable giving. This analysis highlights the trade-off inherent in Romney's plan, where significant tax cuts for the wealthy would require offsetting increases for the middle class. While the exact details of Romney's plan remain unclear, this study provides a plausible scenario that supports the claim's core elements. 
","You comparison shop for cans of tuna. Mitt Romney rides on Donald Trumps jet.A new Obama campaign ad shows those scenes to hammer at the lifestyle differences between struggling middle-class Americans and the Republican presidential candidate. Then it takes aim at Romneys economic proposals.Now he has a plan, theadsays, that would give millionaires another tax break and raises taxes on middle-class families by up to $2,000 a year.We know from ourprevious reportingon Romneys tax plan that it offers across-the-board cuts, including for the very wealthy. But a new independent study offers broader perspective on how taxpayers at all income levels would be affected by Romneys plan.Romneyhassuggestedgeneral parameters:He has outlined specific tax cuts on hiscampaign website. They include: cutting marginal rates by 20 percent on a permanent, across-the-board basis; eliminating interest, dividend and capital gains taxes for taxpayers earning less than $200,000; eliminating the estate tax; and repealing the Alternative Minimum Tax.Romney would also cut the corporate rate to 25 percent.To offset those cuts, Romney hashinted thathe would eliminate some common tax write-offs and deductions for people with high incomes.Knowing all that, the Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution that evaluates tax proposals submitted by presidential candidates,examinedthe effect of Romneys tax rate cuts combined with the elimination of several common tax deductions. Those include the mortgage interest deduction, charitable giving deduction and the exclusion for health insurance. The center published its findings on Aug. 1, 2012.Bottom line: the study found that Romney couldn't keep all his goals based on what we know about his plan.Romney campaigns responseWhen the study appeared online, the Romney campaignposted a responseon its website that did not specifically address the discrepancy.President Obama continues to tout liberal studies calling for more tax hikes and more government spending. We've been down that road before  and it's led us to 41 straight months of unemployment above 8 percent, said Romney spokesman Ryan Williams.Looney is a senior fellow in economic studies at Brookings who has a Ph.D. from Harvard University. He served on Obamas Council of Economic Advisers in 2009 and 2010.William Gale, another of the authors, is vice president of Brookings and director of its economic studies program. He served on President George H.W.

This claim is supported by the justification, which provides detailed information about the education and experience of the government officials, showing that they are highly educated and have extensive backgrounds in government and politics. In contrast, the justification shows that celebrities generally have less formal education and experience in government.

,"In January 2017, an image macro circulated via Facebook taking aim at Muslim refugees in Canada by misstating the nature of several benefits available to them. The misleading nature of the macro begins with suggestion that a smiling gentleman depicted in the image actually entered Canada with ""two wives and six children,"" even though this photograph has actually been used by various ""funny pictures"" web sites for several years.The ""two wives"" claim appears to play off of reports of Muslim male immigrants secretly practicing polygamy, even though the practice of having more than one spouse at a time is illegal in Canada. The Supreme Court of British Columbia upheld that law in a November 2011 ruling involving a non-Muslim polygamous sect.According to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, a federal agency that helps both immigrants and refugees, that law is taken into account during the immigration process.Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) has advised the [United Nations Refugee Agency] that individuals in a polygamous marriage should not be referred for resettlement to Canada. As well, IRCC officers assess privately sponsored refugee cases against Canadas immigration laws, including monogamous marriage requirements. Therefore, individuals practising polygamy would be inadmissible to Canada.The reference to ""privately sponsored refugees"" concerns a separate program, though Syrian and Iraqi refugees are currently exempt from having to show documentation recognizing them as such. Regarding the claim of a ""government-owned townhouse"" and ""a three bedroom government-owned apartment,"" the agency said:The program also provides referrals to agencies in the country's various provinces who can help them acclimate themselves after emigrating. According to the agency:The reference to immigrants' being given ""health cards"" is a possible allusion to the Interim Federal Health Program (IFHP) which provides ""limited, temporary coverage of health-care benefits"" to refugees until they qualify for the country's public healthcare system, which is administered through provincial and territorial governments and not funded by the federal government.As noted above, the benefits payments distributed to refugees do cover the cost of buying foods, but the macro's statement regarding ""access to a halal-only food bank"" misleadingly presents that as another government service. In reality, those services are often operated by private organizations such as the Canadian Muslim Women's Institute, or CMWI. We were unable to get in touch with CMWI for more information prior to publication, but the group's president, Yasmin Ali, explained the circumstances facing many of the people they help in a September 2016 interview:The macro closes by stating that ""voicing your opinion"" could open people up to hate speech charges.

* **Lack of credible sources:** The rumor originates from anonymous social media posts and text messages, lacking any official confirmation from authorities or dealerships. 
* **Logical inconsistencies:** The narrative presents illogical behavior for supposed ISIS operatives, such as wanting a vehicle regardless of inspection status, using the car for only two days, and alerting the suspects to the police's arrival. 
* **Lack of evidence:** There's no credible proof of the men's affiliation with ISIS, and the FBI's actions described in the rumor, like releasing confidential information to car salespeople, are highly implausible.
* **Spreading across locations:** The rumor spreads across multiple dealerships in different cities, suggesting a pattern of fabrication rather than a real event.
* **Lack of official response:** No official statements from the dealerships or authorities confirm the occurrence of such incidents. 

In conclusion, the lack of credible sources, the illogical nature of the events described, and the absence of any supporting evidence from official channels make this rumor a highly improbable and likely false account. 
","  Origins: A series of coordinated terrorist attacks in Paris on 13 November 2015 understandably intensified extant concerns about the risk posed by ISIS; on 22November 2015, a Twitter user published an unsourced rumor pertaining to suspicious Middle Eastern men in the area of Frederick:HOLD UP pic.twitter.com/ISlJQ9jYVw   $B$ (@brookelyles_) November 23, 2015 The tweet contained a screenshot of a (presumably already circulating) text message. Its sender was identified only as ""Gianella,"" and the text described a purported interaction at a car dealership. The rumor lacked a large number of key details such as the date of the incident, the city in which it occurred, and the name of the dealership in question. (The original tweet appeared to occur on 20 November 2015, and was subsequently deleted after screenshots circulated.) Absentbasic information about the claims aside, the rumor didn't make very much logical sense. According to the individual who sent the text, the three men oddly asserted that they wished to buy a vehicle ""whether it passed inspection or not"" (apparently unaware of the higher likelihood of such a transaction being private party). Without ostensible reason, the men then informed the dealership they planned only to use the vehicle for twodays  a tidbit of information that served only to raise possible red flags obstructing the purchase should the dealer opt not to engage in a sketchy, possibly illegallow-profit transaction. The unnamed dealership's manager then purportedly dialed 911 in earshot of the suspicious men (rather than surreptitiously), alerting them to the imminent arrival of police and causing them to flee. At this point, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) arrived and dusted for prints, the results of which appeared to be immediately available, with information disclosed to low-level car dealership employees for unclear reasons. Finally, the FBI opted to inform the car salespeople that the men were in fact likely on a small list of suspected ISIS operatives, despite there being no good reason for federal agents to do so (as it served only to compromise any investigation). The amount of time elapsed between the (still undated) visit and the FBI's disclosure of this information was also not included in the screenshot. Details in the text message weren't the only urban legend hallmarks attached to the tale. Just before the 22 November 2015 tweet went locally viral, the claim popped up at separate dealerships in the vicinity of Frederick and Gaithersburg, Virginia (tweets in the conversation cited the ""friend of a friend"" involved with the original rumor):@A_Roshayy @ForeverrMel I had these guys as my customers too.

"The claim that President Obama signed the SNAP Fairness Act of 2014 into law, allowing food stamp recipients to purchase alcohol and tobacco, is **false**. 

The justification provided clearly states that the ""SNAP Fairness Act of 2014"" does not exist.  This claim was published on a satirical news website, The Salty Badger, known for spreading misinformation and humor.  The website's mission statement even acknowledges their intention to spread ""comedy"" and ""get Scrooge McDuck rich"". 

Further evidence against the claim:

* **No such legislation:** There is no record of any legislation named ""SNAP Fairness Act of 2014"" being passed by Congress or signed by President Obama.
* **SNAP rules:** SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) regulations specifically prohibit the purchase of alcohol and tobacco with SNAP benefits.
* **Photo mismatch:** The photo used to illustrate the article is actually from a different signing ceremony, where President Obama signed the Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act in 2013. 

Therefore, the claim is demonstrably false and should not be taken seriously. 
","Origins:  On 7 December 2014, the Salty Badger web site published an article claiming President Obama had signed legislation called ""The SNAP Fairness Act of 2014"" into law, making it legal to purchase alcohol and tobacco (items that have long been excluded from the food stamps program) with Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) electronic benefit (EBT) cards:The article uses the names of real politicians, like President Obama and Hakeem Jeffries, but that's the only factual element of the story. The SNAP Fairness Act of 2014 does not exist, President Obama didn't sign any bills into law on 7 December 2014, and SNAP benefit cards cannot be used to purchase alcohol or tobacco products. The photo used to illustrate this fictitious article shows President Obama sitting at his desk in August 2013 signing the Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act, not the SNAP Fairness Act, into law. The Salty Badger may not be as well known as fake news sites such as Huzlers or World News Daily Report, but the web site's mission is the same: To spread misinformation. The Salty Badger, which prides itself on being ""not always right, but always first,"" notes in their mission statement that:"
"The label ""NEI"" (Not Enough Information) is accurate in this case. While the article provides evidence that DeJoy, a political ally of Trump, implemented changes to the USPS that resulted in mail delays, it does not provide enough evidence to definitively conclude that these changes were deliberately intended to disenfranchise voters or help Trump win reelection. 

Here's a breakdown of the evidence presented and why it's insufficient to support a definitive claim:

**Evidence supporting the claim:**

* **DeJoy's political ties to Trump:** DeJoy donated significantly to Trump's campaigns and hosted fundraisers for him. This demonstrates political alignment but not necessarily a nefarious scheme.
* **DeJoy's financial interests:**  The article points out DeJoy's past investments in companies that compete with the USPS. While this raises potential ethical conflicts, it doesn't automatically prove an intent to sabotage the USPS for political gain.
* **Changes implemented by DeJoy:** The article details changes DeJoy introduced, including leaving mail at distribution centers and eliminating overtime, which led to mail delays. However, these changes were presented as efforts to improve efficiency and financial stability.

**Missing evidence:**

* **Direct evidence of a scheme:** The article lacks proof that DeJoy's actions were specifically designed to disrupt mail-in voting or benefit Trump's re-election. There is no documentation or testimony proving a direct connection between the changes and the intent to manipulate the election.
* **Alternative explanations:** While the changes led to delays, the article acknowledges that other factors like reduced post office hours and the pandemic could also contribute. 

**Conclusion:**

While the article presents evidence suggesting a potential conflict of interest and actions that led to mail delays, it fails to definitively prove that DeJoy's changes were part of a deliberate scheme to influence the election. The lack of concrete evidence and the possibility of alternative explanations necessitate a ""NEI"" label. 
","As U.S. President Donald Trump accelerated unsubstantiated attacks on the legitimacy of mail-in voting during the summer of 2020, numerous Snopes readers asked us to investigate whether the leader of the U.S. Postal Service was carrying out a nefarious scheme to help Trump win another presidential term.In late July and early August, various rumors surfaced regarding Louis DeJoy, a North Carolina businessman whom the Postal Service's governing board selected to run the agency in May 2020. For example, a viral tweet thread alleged:The claim's underlying notions were these: DeJoy was a political ally to the Republican president, and the new postmaster general had used his new authority to order Postal Service carriers and clerks to slow deliveries to help Trump win the 2020 November election. A backlog of ballots in the weeks or days before Election Day, critics of the president worried, could lead to votes going uncounted or deemed invalid due to state laws governing mail-in election deadlines.Yes. DeJoy, who lives in Greensboro, donated more than $1.2 million to the Trump campaign between August 2016 and February 2020, according to campaign finance reports compiled by the Federal Elections Commission (FEC).It's unclear when or how DeJoy developed a relationship with Trump, and why he decided to support the billionaire's political pursuits. In a 2005 interview with Greensboro's local newspaper, DeJoy  then-CEO of New Breed Logistics, a distribution and warehousing company  appeared less supportive of Trump, saying his self-important attitude on the reality-TV show ""The Apprentice"" was destructive.Nonetheless, by early 2017, DeJoy was among his state's top donors to Trump (see below for The Charlotte Observer's list that ranks DeJoy at No. 3 with a total contribution of $111,000). And by October of that year, DeJoy had become close enough to the president to host him and other donors for fundraiser at his Greensboro house.Also, by that time, DeJoy's wife, Aldona Wos, had been appointed by the president to serve as vice chair of a White House commission that oversees paid fellowships in federal offices, according to the couple's foundation website.The Postal Service's governing board, a group appointed by the president with confirmation from the Senate, selected DeJoy as Postmaster General on May 6, 2020, after what it described as an extensive nationwide search for qualified candidates. At the time of that decision, Trump had appointed all six board members  Chairman Robert Duncan, John Barger, Ron Bloom, Roman Martinez IV, Donald Moak, and William Zollars  since the early days of his presidency.In sum, considering DeJoy's record of donations, as well as evidence of him hosting a Trump fundraiser at his Greensboro home in fall 2017, it is accurate to claim that the new postmaster general is a political ally to the Republican president.In summer 2020, the viral claim about DeJoy  that he had directed carriers to delay mail to benefit Trump's reelection campaign (which we unpack below)  took on another layer: that DeJoy had also allegedly invested $70 million of his own money in delivery companies that compete with the Postal Service.That allegation, which we deemed true (see the explanation below), was particularly worrisome for critics of Trump and DeJoy, who believed the alleged holdings were more proof of the two leaders conspiring together  this time in an attempt to privatize the Postal Service.Here's some context before we dive into DeJoy's personal assets: Conservative Republicans have long pushed to remove government from mail services that they believe should be left to the private commercial market. Since Trump took office, he has called the Postal Service ""a joke"" or Amazon's ""delivery boy,"" considering its package rates, and has floated the idea of eventually privatizing the agency.At the same time, the Postal Service  which does not receive tax dollars for its operating expenses  faces a worsening financial situation due to a 2006 congressional mandate that required the agency to prepay health care benefits of retirees, as well as a decline in first-class mail customers. The coronavirus pandemic exacerbated those long-standing problems, forcing several post offices nationwide to completely close or scale back hours.For instance, on April 9, 2020, roughly one month before DeJoy was selected to lead the Postal Service, then-Postmaster General Megan Brennan said the agency was preparing for a $13 billion revenue shortfall due directly to COVID-19 and an additional $54.3 billion in losses over 10 years. Considering those projections, she said the agency could run out of cash this fiscal year  or the end of September  without federal intervention. (Brennan announced her retirement in October 2019, after more than 30 years with the agency.)The former Postal Service leader made those comments shortly after federal leaders negotiated a $2.2 trillion COVID-19 economic relief package, called the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which, initially, included a $13 billion one-time boost for the mail service. But, purportedly at the urging of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and aides to Trump, congressional leaders removed that provision from the stimulus package, and instead included a $10 billion loan that the Trump administration could leverage in its favor. Then, on July 29, 2020, The Washington Post reported that under DeJoy's leadership, the postal agency gave Mnuchin's office's proprietary information about the Postal Service's most lucrative private-sector contracts, such as Amazon, FedEx and UPS, in exchange for the loan money.On Aug. 13, 2020, during an interview on Fox Business Network, the president said frankly the tug-and-pull over Postal Service funding was part of his administration's plan to try to make it harder for the agency to handle the expected surge in mail-in ballots in the November election. If we dont make a deal, that means they dont get the money, Trump told host Maria Bartiromo, referring to the false claim that Democrats are are proposing a universal mail-in voting system. That means they cant have universal mail-in voting; they just cant have it.For more than 30 years, DeJoy was the CEO of New Breed Logistics, a supply chain business that contracted with a variety of public and private companies, including the Postal Service. In 2014, XPO Logistics acquired DeJoy's company, and he served on the company's executive team or board of directors until May 2018. According to internal documents, which we obtained using the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) database of company filings, XPO Logistics considered its competitors to include DHL, FedEx, UPS, and J.B. Hunt Transport Services. Aside from that evidence, which proved DeJoy's former company competed for business with organizations that also competed with the Postal Service, Snopes uncovered a letter from his wife, Wos, to a White House legal advisor on January 3, 2020, that listed her family's financial assets, known as ""Attachment A."" According to that list, the family had stock in companies including UPS, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc., and XPO Logistics, Inc.She wrote the letter in response to a nomination by the Trump administration to serve as U.S. ambassador to Canada, and she said she would divest from all holdings in the document within 90 days of her confirmation. However, as of this writing, Wos had not been sworn into the position. The letter, which was available via the Office of Government Ethics, read:As of June 15, 2020, the day DeJoy assumed his role as postmaster general, The Washington Post reported the couple had between $30.1 million and $75.3 million in assets in Postal Service competitors or contractors. XPO Logistics represented the vast majority of those investments, and the couple's combined stake in UPS and trucking company J.B. Hunt, for examples, was roughly $265,000.On DeJoy's first day, the Senate's top Democrat, Charles Schumer of New York, said in letter to the Postal Service's board of governors' chairman: ""[DeJoy's] financial interests in companies that have business ties with the Postal Services, as well as his extensive campaign fundraising efforts, raise questions"" over his ethical conflicts of interest and partisan interests.By that point, a spokeswoman for DeJoy told journalists he had resigned as finance chair for the Republican National Convention, and would ""comply with any financial divestitures that are required"" for the new leadership position.Upon our analysis, the rumor seems to have stemmed from a series of directives DeJoy gave Postal Service employees since he took over the agency. On his first day, for example, he addressed the agency in a video that alluded to impending changes under his leadership that aimed to create a ""viable operating model,"" though he did not go into specifics.A July 10, 2020, internal document to managers, which Snopes received from the American Postal Workers Union and refers to an ""operational pivot"" for the agency, said the following, for example:The initial step in our pivot is targeted on transportation and the soaring costs we incur due to late trips and extra trips, which costs the organization somewhere around $200 million in added expenses.But perhaps most relevant to the claim, the DeJoy-sponsored directives included instructions for employees to leave letters or packages at distribution centers if they delayed carriers from their routes  contradicting previous rules for deliveries  and said the Postal Service would no longer pay employees overtime to complete all mail deliveries. The July 10, 2020 memo said:We also considered a separate message to employees in July 2020 that said, under a new initiative, carriers in certain regions would not sort any mail during the morning and instead clock in, retrieve sorted mail from the previous day and limit time in the office as much as possible. Then, when they returned from the streets, they would sort all available mail for the next day.The agency said the extra spending on employees' overtime or delivery trips had not improved ""our performance scores,"" without going into detail on what that meant, and framed the changes as necessary steps to improve its financial position. A July 27, 2020, public statement from DeJoy said:Soon after the directives, American Postal Workers Union President Mark Dimondstein told us in a phone interview that employees and customers across the country were noticing mail delays. In the Philadelphia region, for instance, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported situations where residents were going upwards of three weeks without receiving packages and letters, and postal union leaders and carriers said mail was piling up at offices, unscanned and unsorted.Specifically, they worried the new requirements for post office carriers and clerks would lead to backlogs of mail-in ballots and thus create challenges for elections officials who, in the majority of states, must invalidate ballots that reach them after Election Day  even if they were postmarked before that date. Rep. Carolyn Maloney, a Democrat from New York, for example, led colleagues in writing a letter to DeJoy on July 20, 2020, that said:What we do know for truth is this administration is, in written record, proposing and planning to sell the post office to private corporations, i.e. privatizing. ...That was June 2018. We also know as a fact that ...that [there are] calls for reduced service, increased prices, and less workers' rights and benefits. So if you take those two things together, certainly if they're implemented, then they're going to cause delays in mail; they're going to cause service being undermined. ...Days later, he said in a statement to news media that certain deadlines concerning mail-in ballots, may be incompatible with the Postal Services delivery standards, especially if election officials dont pay more for first-class postage. To the extent that states choose to use the mail as part of their elections, they should do so in a manner that realistically reflects how the mail works, he said.Then, on Aug. 18, 2020, DeJoy issued a statement in which he said he would temporarily suspend initiatives ""that have been raised as areas of concern as the nation prepares to hold an election in the midst of a devastating pandemic,"" including the controversial July 2020 directives that eliminated overtime and some delivery trips. The statement read:"
"The claim that political donations from the DeVos family played a role in Betsy DeVos' confirmation as Secretary of Education is **true**. While the evidence doesn't directly prove a quid-pro-quo exchange, it highlights several points that support this claim:

* **Significant Donations:** The DeVos family has a long history of substantial contributions to Republican candidates and committees, including millions of dollars in the 2016 election cycle.
* **Republican Vote:**  All votes in favor of DeVos' confirmation came from Republican senators, leading some to speculate on a connection between donations and support.
* **DeVos's Acknowledgement:** DeVos herself admitted to the possibility of her family contributing around $200 million to the Republican party over the years, acknowledging the scale of their political investment.
* **Senator Sanders's Question:** Senator Sanders directly asked DeVos if she believed her family's contributions influenced her nomination, suggesting a potential link between wealth, political giving, and appointment to high office.

However, the explanation also acknowledges key counterarguments:

* **No Direct Evidence:** While there were donations, there is no conclusive evidence proving the money bought votes or guaranteed DeVos's confirmation.
* **Other Factors:**  Partisan politics likely played a significant role, with the Washington Post suggesting that the outcome would have been different if Democrats controlled the Senate. 
* **Proportionality:** The DeVos family's donations, although substantial, were a small fraction of the total funds raised by the Republican candidates they supported.

In conclusion, while the evidence is circumstantial, it supports the claim that political donations from the DeVos family contributed to Betsy DeVos's confirmation as Secretary of Education. The  magnitude of their contributions, the Republican-only vote, and DeVos's own acknowledgment of her family's political investment provide evidence that suggests a possible link between donations and support for her candidacy. However, it's essential to acknowledge the lack of direct evidence and the presence of other potential factors influencing the confirmation vote. 
","The above-displayed chart first appeared on Reddit, but the data it incorporates was taken from a report published by the Center for American Progress. That report included another chart showing the DeVos family's campaign contributions:A similar report filed by the Center for Responsive Politics stated that ""Betsy DeVos and her relatives have given at least $20.2 million to Republican candidates, party committees, PACs and super PACs"" since 1989:The Washington Post posited a much more likely explanation for the confirmation vote breakdown  partisanship:During DeVos' confirmation hearing in January 2017, Senator Bernie Sanders asked her about how much her family had contributed to the Republican Party over the years, and she averred that an estimate of about $200 million might be accurate:Senate education committee Chairman Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) told Politico that the DeVos family's contributions were made legally and were properly disclosed:A spokesperson for Florida senator Marco Rubio, who was singled out for having received nearly $100,000 from the DeVos family, defended his acceptance of those contributions:"
"The label ""False"" is accurate because the claim that individuals are involved in sex trafficking by labeling vehicles as potential victims is unfounded and unsupported by evidence. The justification provides several points:

1. **Lack of Official Confirmation:**  Police in Bricktown, New Jersey, and Brick Township, where the rumor originated, confirmed they have no reports or information about this activity. 
2. **Unreliable Sources:** The rumor's origins are traced back to an anonymous ""lady"" who warned a friend about the code ""1f1b"" on a vehicle. This lacks any credible source like police, news reports, or even Walmart staff.
3. **Spread of Misinformation:**  The rumor spread through social media, with details changing and becoming more exaggerated as it was shared, including inaccurate locations.
4. **Similar Baseless Rumors:**  This is not the first time false rumors about sex traffickers using specific methods to target victims have circulated online, including those involving zip ties, roses, or people lying down in front of cars.
5. **Expert Opinion:** The Polaris Project, a non-profit focused on human trafficking, states that forced kidnapping is a prevalent myth about trafficking, and that traffickers typically use psychological manipulation, not physical markings.

Therefore, the claim about sex traffickers labeling vehicles with codes to identify potential victims is a false and unfounded rumor. 
","In August 2020, a photograph showing the figures ""1f1b"" written on the back window of a vehicle started to circulate on social media along with a warning about an alleged tactic being used by sex traffickers to flag potential targets. Those sharing this meme claimed that this term stood for either ""1 female 1 boy,"" or ""1 female 1 baby,"" and that cars were being tagged with these codes by sex traffickers. The meme received a viral boost when it was posted to actor James Woods' Twitter account:The text of this post states that this happened to a ""friend of mine."" When we read a little further, we see that this ""friend"" was warned about this new criminal tactic by a random stranger. Not a police officer, a news reporter, or even a Walmart employee  just an anonymous ""lady."" The original post received a few thousand shares, but this post received far wider circulation. And the farther we moved away from the rumor's origins, the muddier the details got. One poster, for instance, informed people that this incident took place in Bricktown, Oklahoma City, despite the fact that there is no Walmart in this location.The local Patch website reported:Nor was this the first time that this type of baseless warning has gone viral on social media. In July 2019, for example, we wrote about the false claim that sex traffickers were flagging targets by placing zip ties on houses, mailboxes, or vehicles. In December of that year, a false rumor circulated that sex traffickers were laying down in front of vehicles in order to trick them into stopping. That same month saw the spread of another false rumor holding that roses were being placed on cars to mark potential targets. Human trafficking is a real problem in the world, but the schemes described above are not based on any real-world threats. In fact, The Polaris Project, a non-profit that runs the U.S. National Human Trafficking Hotline, writes that the forced kidnapping aspect of the aforementioned rumors is one of the most prevalent myths when it comes to trafficking:"
"The statement ""There are currently 6 million jobs available in this country that are due in part to the skills gap"" is **True**. The claim is supported by the following points:

* **The Bureau of Labor Statistics' Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) reported 6,044,000 job openings in April 2017**, confirming the accuracy of the number cited.
* **Economists acknowledge that a skills gap contributes to job vacancies**, but they emphasize that it's not the sole factor.
* **While some vacancies require specialized training**, others can be filled by workers who acquire skills on the job.
* **Economists like Gary Burtless point out that many job seekers have the capacity to learn necessary skills quickly**, suggesting that the skills gap isn't insurmountable.
* **The statement acknowledges that other factors contribute to the job openings, such as the ""image gap""**,  which refers to the perception that manufacturing jobs are undesirable, particularly among millennials.

Therefore, while the skills gap may not be the only reason for all 6 million job openings, it is a significant factor. The evidence presented from the JOLTS data and the expert opinions of economists confirm the statement's accuracy. 
","During aninterviewwithFox & Friends, Ivanka Trumpdiscussedone of the challenges of the current economy -- that job vacancies exist, but many people who arent working arent qualified to fill them. Her comments came during a week that the White House had devoted to messages about the American workforce.Every month, the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics releases data from a survey called theJob Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS. One of the key statistics in the survey is job openings nationally.Another economist, Aparna Mathur of the American Enterprise Institute, hastestifiedthat for many manufacturing jobs, a drag on hiring comes not only from a skills gap but also an image gap."
"The claim that President Trump donated his entire $400,000 annual salary to rebuild military cemeteries is **false**. 

Here's why:

* **Mathematical Impossibility:** Trump has consistently donated his salary in quarterly installments, starting in 2017.  By the time the claims about the military cemetery donation emerged in late 2018, he had already donated the first quarter's salary to the Department of Veterans Affairs for a different initiative. 
* **Misleading Sources:**  The claims originated from social media posts and articles on right-wing websites, citing no credible sources. The purported ""spending report"" referenced by some sources was a White House personnel report that did not mention Trump's salary or donations.
* **Misinterpretation and Distortion:**  The claims stemmed from a misinterpretation of a Forbes article about the White House personnel report. The article correctly stated that Trump donated his first-quarter salary to the Department of the Interior in 2017. However, the rumor spread online replaced ""first-quarter"" with ""all $400,000"" and falsely claimed the donation was for military cemeteries. 
* **Actual Donations:**  Trump's actual donations have been documented by major news outlets. They have included funding for a Civil War site, a STEM camp for children, an opioid awareness campaign, an infrastructure grant program, a Veterans Affairs caregiver program, a small business program for veterans, alcohol abuse research, and efforts to combat the opioid crisis. 

In conclusion, the claim that Trump donated his entire salary to rebuild military cemeteries is based on misinformation, distorted information, and a lack of evidence. 
","During his 2016 presidential campaign, Republican candidate Donald Trump, a billionaire real estate developer, vowed that if elected he would forgo the $400,000 annual presidential salary. So far as president Trump has stuck to that promise, handing over checks every three months for various projects overseen by different government departments.In the first quarter of 2017, for example, President Trump donated $78,333 (his $100,000 salary for that quarter, after taxes) to the Department of the Interior, specifically for the National Park Service's maintenance of an historic Civil War site. His contribution was put towards two projects at Antietam National Battlefield in Maryland.In July 2017, the White House announced in a press release that President Trump had donated his second-quarter salary to a science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) camp for children, overseen by the Education Department. He signed over his third-quarter salary to the Department of Health and Human Services for a public awareness campaign about opioid addiction, and the last of his 2017 salary went towards an infrastructure grant program overseen by the U.S. Department of Transportation.As the Washington Post has pointed out, some of the initiatives President Trump donated to were at uncertain stages of development or did not yet exist at the time he made his contribution, which prompted some additional scrutiny, but President Trump has nonetheless stayed true to his word and handed over a check representing his presidential salary every three months.Trump continued this tradition in 2018, donating his first-quarter salary to the Department of Veterans Affairs, a sum which then-Acting VA Secretary Robert Wilkie said had been earmarked for ""caregiver support in the form of mental health and peer support programs, financial aid, education training, and research.""  The president donated another quarter's salary to the U.S. Small Business Administration for the purpose of establishing an Emerging Leaders program focused ""on helping veterans start small businesses after military life."" And the third quarter of his 2018 salary went to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, according to the Associated Press. On 18 March 2019, Trump announced on Twitter he was donating a quarter of his salary to the Department of Homeland Security. On 26 November 2019, Trump announced he was donating again, this time to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Health in order to help battle the nation's opioid crisis.'Military Cemeteries'In late July and early August 2018, scattered social media posts and memes claimed that the president had donated his entire $400,000 salary to the Department of the Interior, for the purpose of rebuilding military cemeteries. Many of these posts criticized the news media for not having reported on this purported donation. On 31 July 2018, for example, conservative radio host Mark Simone wrote, in a tweet that has since been deleted:White House sent their spending report to Congress. This was in it: ""Instead of taking his salary, Trump donated all $400,000 to the Department of the Interior where it will be used for construction and repair needs at military cemeteries!"" Media gave this no coverage. Charlie Kirk, a prominent conservative activist and founder of the Turning Point USA organization, followed suit:News the media didnt report today:Today @realDonaldTrump donated his $400,000 salary to rebuilding military cemeteries Charlie Kirk (@charliekirk11) August 1, 2018One Facebook user garnered almost 150,000 shares within three days for a 31 July post which made similar claims:And on 2 August, ""Uncle Sam's Misguided Children"" posted a widely-shared meme on Facebook, which was almost identical to Charlie Kirk's tweet:These social media posts were accompanied by articles published by various right-wing web sites including the Gateway Pundit, the Right Scoop, and the viral content web site Social News Daily.AnalysisThere were two immediate problems with this set of claims. First, President Trump could not possibly donate his entire $400,000 annual salary for 2018 for the purpose of rebuilding military cemeteries, because he has already donated the first quarter's worth of that salary to the Department of Veterans Affairs for an entirely separate initiative. So he only had three-quarters of his salary left to distribute, a mathematical fact that undermines the credibility of these claims.Second, the social media posts and articles making this claim were very thinly sourced, to say the least. Neither the viral Facebook post nor meme that we highlighted above cited any source, and the three news articles we mentioned all relied on the two tweets from Charlie Kirk and Mark Simone.Kirk's tweet cited no source whatsoever. Simone claimed that the information came from a White House ""spending report"" sent to Congress, which he asserted contained the following statement: ""Instead of taking his salary, Trump donated all $400,000 to the Department of the Interior where it will be used for construction and repair needs at military cemeteries!""Simone did not include a link to that report in his tweet, and neither he nor Kirk responded to our requests for clarification or documentation.The White House did send a somewhat related report to Congress a month before these claims emerged online. The White House Office's Annual Report to Congress on White House Personnel lists the names, titles and salaries of White House employees, and the 2018 report, published on 29 June, made no mention of President Trump's salary, nor his donations from that salary.Furthermore, we did not find the quotation that Simone included in his tweet in any official White House document or report to Congress. We did, however, find it in several online postings from the summer of 2017. As posted to the web site MyCrazyEmail.net on 25 July 2017, the message typically read as follows:The Trump administration released their annual report to Congress on White House Office Personnel. It includes the name, status, salary and position title of all 377 White House employees. The report also said that Trump decided not to take a dime of his salary, instead he donated it to an amazing cause.... Its what the report said Trump did with this salary that has everyone talking! Instead of taking his salary, Trump donated all $400,000 to the Department of the Interior where it will be used for construction and repair needs at military cemeteries! AMAZING! Its so great to have a President who loves our brave military men and women so much! Oh, and wheres the media coverage of this? Oh thats right, they dont cover anything good that the President does. So the claim that Trump donated his entire $400,000 annual salary for rebuilding military cemeteries actually comes from online rumors posted in 2017. This means the vast majority of claims made in July and August 2018 are false on this basis alone, since they stated that Trump's donation had happened ""today."" However, the claim was as false in 2017 as it was in 2018. As we outlined at the beginning of this article, President Trump distributed his 2017 salary in four separate chunks, to four separate projects, none of which involved military cemeteries. The White House had already announced two of those donations by 26 July 2017, so the viral rumor was demonstrably false even as it first emerged online, twelve months before Mark Simone and Charlie Kirk's viral tweets. The 2017 rumor, which was the source of Simone's tweet, claimed that the 2017 White House Office Personnel report had described President Trump's intention to donate his whole salary for repairs on military cemeteries. That official report, which can be viewed here, did not mention the president's salary, his donations from that salary, nor cemeteries of any kind.The original source of this flurry of inaccurate rumors appears to have been a 2 July 2017 article in Forbes magazine, about that year's White House Office Personnel report. The rumor which spread online later that summer plagiarized whole sections of the article, indicating that the Forbes piece provided a template for subsequent distortions and falsehoods -- particularly the section that read as follows:While on the campaign trail, Donald Trump vowed to forego his paycheck. However, Article II of the United States Constitution mandates a presidential salary. In the first quarter, President Trump donated his pay to the Dept. of Interior for construction and repair needs at military cemeteries.The president did donate his first-quarter 2017 salary to the Department of the Interior, but not for the reconstruction of military cemeteries. This inaccuracy was then compounded in the subsequent online rumor, which took Forbes' accurate description of the donation as being ""in the first quarter,"" and simply replaced it with ""all $400,000"" (i.e., the entire yearly salary).According to a Department of the Interior press release, President Trump's $78,333 donation formed part of a larger $263,545 fund which was used by the National Park Service to make repairs at Antietam National Battlefield in Maryland, site of the Civil War Battle of Antietam (or the Battle of Sharpsburg, as it was commonly known in the South).A press release described the project in detail:The donation will restore the historic Newcomer House on the Antietam battlefield, and will underwrite the replacement of 5,000 linear feet of deteriorated rail fencing along the Hagerstown Turnpike where some of the most intense fighting of the battle occurred.There is a cemetery at Antietam National Battlefield, but President Trump's donation had nothing to do with it. ConclusionThe claim that President Donald Trump decided either in 2017 or 2018 to donate his entire $400,000 salary to the reconstruction of military cemeteries, and that a blinkered, biased news media refused to report this, is false.Each of President Trump's actual salary donations (executed in quarterly disbursements, not once a year) has been reported by major news media, including some of the nation's biggest and most widely-read news outlets.The news media has not reported on the president's donation of his entire $400,000 annual salary for the reconstruction of military cemeteries due to the plainest reason of all: because it hasn't happened.In the first quarter of 2017, for example, President Trump donated $78,333 (his $100,000 salary for that quarter, after taxes) to the Department of the Interior, specifically for the National Park Service's maintenance of an historic Civil War site.

"The claim that Macy's sent a letter to Rick Perry urging him to veto the equal pay bill is **True**. The justification provides several pieces of evidence supporting this claim:

* **Macy's letter:** The article cites a letter written on Macy's letterhead, obtained by Senfronia Thompson's office, that directly requests Perry to veto the legislation.
* **Macy's confirmation:**  Macy's spokeswoman Bethany Charlton confirmed that the company sent the letter dated May 31, 2013. 
* **Perry's veto:**  The article states that Rick Perry vetoed House Bill 950, the equal pay bill, on June 14, 2013.

Therefore, the evidence strongly indicates that Macy's did indeed send a letter to Perry advocating for the veto of the equal pay bill.

"The statement ""Even with a permanent income tax increase... the budget is more than $1 billion out of balance"" is labeled as **True**. 

This claim is based on Governor Bruce Rauner's assertion that the Illinois budget enacted by the General Assembly is deeply in the red, despite a significant income tax increase.  Here's why the statement is considered true:

* **Tier 3 Pension Plan:**  The budget assumes $500 million in savings from the Tier 3 pension plan, which allows state workers to opt for a 401(k)-style savings plan. However, the plan's effective date is July 1, 2019, meaning those savings won't materialize until FY 2020. This validates Rauner's claim that the current budget doesn't reflect those projected savings.
* **Bond Issuance:** The budget includes a provision for the state to borrow up to $6 billion to pay down the bill backlog.  However, the projected surplus is only sufficient to support $3 billion in borrowing. Rauner argues that the additional $3 billion in borrowing would require an increase in debt service costs, creating a budgetary shortfall.
* **Thompson Center Sale:** The budget relies on $240 million in proceeds from the sale of the Thompson Center.  But the sale has been stalled by political disputes, and it is uncertain if it will occur or fetch the projected price. This makes the budget's surplus highly fragile.
* **Revenue Projections:** Rauner's office cites revised revenue projections that are $500 million lower than the General Assembly's estimate. This suggests a potential shortfall that was not accounted for in the budget.

While the exact amount of the budgetary imbalance is debatable, the evidence presented by Rauner's office highlights several factors that could create a shortfall exceeding $1 billion.  Therefore, his statement is considered **Mostly True**. 
","Illinois record budget standoffended July 6with legislative Democrats, joined by a handful of Republicans, approving a $36 billion spending plan for the fiscal year that began July 1, which is underpinned by a 32 percent hike in the state income tax rate. Enactment came July 6 over the objections of Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, who two days earlier hadvetoed the budget.More than two months later -- after a summer in whichtension over school fundingmade the budget debate seem a faint and distant memory -- Rauner has revived his claim that the Legislature has placed the state on a path to fiscal doom.Even with a permanent income tax increase costing the average Illinois household more than $1,000 a year, the budget is more than $1 billion out of balance, Rauner said in aSept. 7 press release. However, his office cautions not to read too much into the downward revision of the unbalanced budget claim from $2 billion in July to $1 billion now. The difference, the administration says, is due to technical reasons and doesnt mean the budget is in better shape than the governor originally asserted.TheIllinois Constitutiondefines a budget as balanced when spending doesnt exceed funds estimated to be available for the fiscal year. But estimated has given politicians license to stretch or shrink their definition of balanced to suit their needs.The Civic Federation, a Chicago-based government fiscal watchdog, noted in aSept. 7 analysisthat the budget as passed on July 6 -- which contained a $360 million operating surplus -- met the textbook definition of balanced.Governor and ILGA should work together to create credibility of States FY2018 surplus for borrowing plan to proceedhttps://t.co/thNHqFGLBKBut Rauner spokesman Jason Schaumburg said savings from this plan wont happen during this budget year. And Illinois Teachers Retirement System Executive Director Dick Ingramtold the Better Government Associationthat TRS anticipates an effective date of July 1, 2019, for the new plan. That means savings wont show up until FY 2020.The $500 million savings figure in the current budget came from an estimate originally presented in Raunersill-fated budget proposalfrom last February. That budget also contained $4.6 billion in phantom money identified only as Working together on grand bargain.And it washardly the only timeRauner has pushed a budget full of the same sort of holes he now condemns. Thefirst budget Rauner proposed in 2015anticipated $2.2 billion in savings from a sweeping overhaul of pensions that at the time was of questionable constitutionality and was soon rendered invalid by the Illinois Supreme Court.TheSept. 7 press releasein which Rauner made his claim about the budget imbalance also announced that the state would issue $6 billion in bonds to pay down part of the$16 billion bill backlogthat accrued during the budget impasse of 2015-2017. The Illinois Comptrollers Office said at the end of FY 2017 that the state was paying late payment penalties of 9 and 12 percent on $5.5 billion contained in the backlog. This costs the state about$2 million a day, according to the comptroller. By borrowing, the state can lower that rate by up to half while also getting payment quickly to creditors.Medicaid bills make up $4.1 billion of the $16 billion backlog, according to the Illinois Comptrollers Office. But an even bigger chunk of the backlog comes from bills owed to providers in the State Employee Group Insurance Program. In itsMay monthly report, the General Assemblys Commission on Government Forecasting and Accountability said the state owed $4.65 billion in group health insurance payments plus $462 million in late fees. The comptrollers office now estimates group health insurance costs make up $5.1 billion of the total backlog.The Civic Federation report also emphasizes that the $360 million surplus claimed in the budget (and disputed by Rauner) is fragile at best. It is built in large part on proceeds of $240 million from the sale of the James R. Thompson Center in Chicago. The sale of the 17-story behemoth in the heart of Chicagos Loop has been stymied by political fighting ever sinceRauner first proposed itin October 2015."
"The claim states that the IRS sent thousands of tax refunds to the same addresses. The justification provides evidence from a Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) report that identified ten addresses that were each issued thousands of tax refunds using ITINs in 2011. Four of these addresses were in Atlanta, Georgia, with one address receiving nearly 24,000 tax returns and over $46 million in refunds.  

While the TIGTA report identified potential fraud, it did not definitively conclude that fraud was occurring. The report stated that the analysis of ITIN application data revealed ""indications of possible fraud,"" suggesting that further investigation was necessary. The report also acknowledged that the addresses may correspond to service providers who assist immigrants with tax returns or that the perpetrators of any potential fraud could be domestic criminals rather than ""aliens.""

Therefore, while the justification provides evidence of suspicious activity, it doesn't definitively prove that the IRS sent thousands of tax refunds to the same addresses as a result of fraud. 

**Therefore, the label ""True"" is not fully supported by the provided claim and justification.**  The information suggests a possibility of fraud, but does not definitively prove it.  Further investigation would be needed to determine the veracity of the claim. 
","Once the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) began using Social Security Numbers (SSN) as the primary form of taxpayer identification, it ran into a problem: how to identify people who had federal tax reporting or filing requirements but were not eligible to obtain Social Security Numbers (such as non-resident foreign nationals who earned income which was taxable in the U.S.).  The IRS' initial solution was to create temporary numbers known as Internal Revenue Service Numbers (IRSN) to process the tax returns of such persons, but that system created a problem because IRSNs were assigned to tax returns rather than to the individuals filing those tax returns, a situation which made it difficult to track all the returns filed by any particular person.  To remedy that problem, in 1996 the IRS introduced the Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN), nine-digit numbers similar in structure to SSNs issued to individuals (regardless of their immigration status) who are required to have U.S. taxpayer identification numbers but are not eligible to obtain SSNs:In July 2012, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) issued a final report titled ""Substantial Changes Are Needed to the Individual Taxpayer Identification Number Program to Detect Fraudulent Applications"" which stated the TIGTA had initiated an audit of the ITIN assignment process due to two congressional complaints alleging IRS management personnel were encouraging the approval of fraudulent ITIN applications, and that it found the complaints to be largely accurate:"
"The claim that a bill called the ""Handgun Safety and Registration Act"" would require handgun owners to list their guns on their federal income tax returns is **false**. 

While a bill with this name was introduced in the Senate in 2000 (SB 2099), it did not contain any provisions for requiring gun owners to list their firearms on their tax returns.  The bill aimed to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to require the registration of handguns, but it did not specify any connection to tax forms. 

The claim that this bill could have been passed without a vote in Congress is also false.  Like any other Congressional bill, it would have required a vote in both houses of Congress and the President's signature to become law.  Furthermore, the $50 tax mentioned in the bill would have only applied to gun manufacturers, not gun owners. 

The Handgun Safety and Registration Act of 2000 never made it out of committee and was not brought to a vote.  
","Variations:  An August 2009 version of the Handgun Safety and Registration Act e-mail combined it with the Blair Holt e-mail that truthfully claims a bill before Congress would prohibit ownership of handguns by those who have not obtained firearms licenses.The issue back in 2000 was Senate Bill 2099, introduced in February of that year by Senator Jack Reed, a Democrat from Rhode Island.  S. 2099 was titled the ""Handgun Safety and Registration Act of 2000"" and sought ""to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to require the registration of handguns, and for other purposes.""  The National Firearms Act of 1934 established (among other things) a tax on both the manufacture and the transfer of firearms, required that each person who transfers a firearm file an application That the intent of this bill was to effect nationwide registration of handguns is unmistakable.

"The claim that the Daughters of the Father Christian Academy, a voucher school that closed after 9 days in 2015, received $5.4 million in taxpayer subsidies since opening is **Mostly True**. 

While the school did close after 9 days in the 2015-16 school year, it had been operating for eight years prior, making the statement about the school being ""new"" misleading. 

The $5.4 million figure represents the **total** amount of taxpayer subsidies the school received since its inception in 2007, not just the amount received in the year it closed. This clarifies the statement and removes the implication that the money was lost immediately after being received. 

Therefore, while the school's closure after such a short period is a significant event, the claim accurately reflects the school's total funding and its duration of operation. The claim is considered ""Mostly True"" because of the potentially misleading implication about the time frame of receiving the funding. 
","The school ran into financial trouble that led to canceled bus service at the end of the school year. In aMay 14, 2015 press releaseexecutive director Doris Pinkley blamed lower-than-expected enrollment.The department issued an orderAug. 4, 2015banning the school from participating in the voucher program because the school did not have a qualified administrator on staff.

"The claim that the Obama administration, with the help of Pelosi and Schumer, gave Iran $150 billion in cash is false. This statement is based on a misunderstanding of the 2015 nuclear deal. The deal did not involve the U.S. giving Iran money. Instead, it unfroze billions of dollars worth of Iranian assets that had been frozen due to sanctions. These assets were already owned by Iran and were not a direct payment from the U.S. government. Furthermore, the $150 billion figure is an exaggerated estimate of the total value of these assets, with multiple sources reporting much lower figures, ranging from $30-$50 billion. This unfreezing of assets was a consequence of the nuclear deal and had no connection to the U.S. federal budget or the construction of a border wall. 
","President Trump battled Congress over his request for $5.7 billion to fulfill a 2016 campaign promise to ""build the wall."" The resulting impasse over budget appropriations for the wall's construction led to a protracted shutdown of the federal government.As with many memes, the one above paired two topics that were unrelated to each other, along with a generous helping of inaccuracy. The ""enemy of the U.S."" referred to Iran, which was never given a $150 billion cash payment by President Barack Obama with the help of Pelosi and Schumer. Instead, billions of dollars worth of Iranian assets were unfrozen as a result of the 2015 nuclear deal negotiated with that country, which had nothing to do with the U.S. federal budget or border wall construction. Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 12, 2018The $150 billion figure is an estimate of the value of Iranian assets that were unfrozen as a result of Iran's agreeing to the terms of the nuclear agreement reached with seven nations in 2015, including the U.S., an agreement formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. In other words, Iran gained access to assets that already belonged to them, assets that had been frozen in various financial institutions around the world due to sanctions imposed to curb Irans nuclear program. But Iran didn't get $150 billion in cash, nor did they receive any money at all from U.S. taxpayers -- they only regained access to assets that had been frozen in several different countries (not just the U.S.), and the $150 billion figure was merely an upper estimate.Moreover, that $150 billion figure was the highest estimate of the value of Iran's frozen assets, with multiple sources reporting much lower figures. For example, Adam J. Szubin, Acting Under Secretary of Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, supplied written testimony to a U.S. Senate committee in August 2015 stating that U.S. assessment of the total liquid assets Iran would regain control of as a result of the nuclear agreement was ""a little more than $50 billion"":"
"The claim that a Reddit user found treasure in his grandparents' barn is **true** with some qualifications. While a Reddit user named EvilEnglish did find a ""treasure"" of rare coins, watches, jewelry, and money in a safe belonging to his grandparents in Tennessee, the safe was located in their farmhouse, not a barn. Additionally, online advertisements and slideshow articles featuring this story have misrepresented the Reddit user, using images of a different man and unrelated houses. The original story, however, was verified through the Reddit user's own posts and subsequent news reports, confirming the discovery of the ""treasure"" in the farmhouse. Therefore, the claim is accurate in its core statement of the Reddit user finding treasure, but inaccurate in its description of the location being a barn and in its use of unrelated images in online advertising.

The photograph of the supposed Redditer is of Chris Seiter, a writer for exgirlfriendrecovery.com, and the picture of the old house appeared to also be unrelated.We found multiple photographs in the 60-page slideshow article that resulted from clicking the ad that also had nothing to do with what actually happened, despite the fact that they were credited to him. Further, the discovery was made in EvilEnglish' grandparents' farmhouse, not a ""barn."" Despite being credited to the Reddit user, these two pictures appeared to have nothing to do with the real story about the treasure found in the EvilEnglish's grandparents' home or safe.In the original story that was posted in 2013, EvilEnglish, who did not provide his real name, said that his father died in 2009. That led to his inheriting his grandparents' farmhouse in middle Tennessee, a property they had owned between around the late 1970s and 1997.On April 30, 2013, EvilEnglish posted to Reddit that the safe had been unlocked, revealing ""treasure"" from his grandparents' past.Inside, he found ""dozens of rare coins, pocket watches and wristwatches, jewelry, and stacks of soggy money,"" according to KSL.com.The original Imgur album of photos, as well as multiple YouTube videos, are no longer available.

"The claim that an ""illegal alien"" was fired from a McDonald's in Alabama for refusing to serve police officers and saying ""We don't serve pigs"" is **false**.  

This claim, published by Conservative Daily Post, lacks any supporting evidence.  There is no mention of such an incident on McDonald's official social media accounts, no news reports, and the photo used in the article is a stock image from 2012.  

Furthermore, the claim appears to be part of a larger pattern of fabricated stories about police officers being mistreated in restaurants, which emerged during a period of heightened tensions between police and communities in the summer of 2016. 

These factors strongly suggest that the Conservative Daily Post article was deliberately fabricated to incite outrage and promote a particular narrative. 
","On 18 July 2016 the web site Conservative Daily Post published an article reporting that an ""illegal alien"" had been fired after she declined to serve police officers at an Alabama McDonald's, declaring that we dont serve pigs.The outrage-provoking article was set against the backdrop of a month of tensions between police officers and community members in July 2016. The shooting deaths of civilians Alton Sterling and Philando Castile led to national protests, and police officers were killed in ambush shootings in Dallas and Baton Rouge.In that period, several rumors of police officers ""shunned"" or mistreated at restaurants circulated online. A group of policemen in Pennsylvania said they paid the bill of a couple who refused to sit near them, a sheriff in Washington reported that a Chinese restaurant's owners had said law enforcement was not welcome there, and officers in Baton Rouge maintained that a server at Las Palmas restaurant had put mucus in their drinks. @McDonalds #Illegal Alien Denied Cops Service, We Dont Serve Pigs https://t.co/5n3esRSePy #BoycottMcDonalds Jan Johnson (@JanJohnsonFL) July 18, 2016Illegal Alien McDonald's clerk tells police: ""We don't serve your kind"" Get the fuck out of my country, you bitch!! https://t.co/3HGU4ml3ow  obamasucksballs (@obamasucksballs) July 19, 2016Conservative Daily Post claimed McDonald's had fired the employee and apologized, but no mention of any such controversy (by the company or by commenters) was visible on the hamburger chain's Twitter account, nor on McDonald's Facebook page save for one cryptic comment:"
"The label ""False"" is applied to the claim that Juval Aviv correctly predicted upcoming terrorist attacks against the UK and the US. This is because the evidence presented does not support the claim of Aviv accurately predicting the London subway bombing. While the justification mentions Aviv's prediction of a London subway bombing on the Bill O'Reilly show, it does not provide any credible evidence to confirm this prediction. Furthermore, the evidence indicates that Aviv's prediction of a simultaneous attack on 5-8 US cities, including rural areas, within 90 days did not come to fruition. This suggests that his predictions regarding terrorist attacks have been inaccurate. 

Moreover, there are substantial doubts about Aviv's credibility, as several sources, including the Israeli government, have disputed his claims regarding his background and experience in intelligence work. 

Therefore, based on the available information, the claim that Juval Aviv accurately predicted terrorist attacks is deemed false. 
","American RadioWorks, however, suggests that Aviv was the target of a smear campaign by the FBI for his  report implicating  U.S. govermment agents in the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing:His predictions about terrorists hitting the U.S. in ""six, seven, or eight cities simultaneously"" sometime within the next ""ninety days at most"" are outdated, as he issued them back in July 2005.  It seems safe to say from this vantage point that those predictions were not correct, as no such attacks occurred."

"The claim that Nostradamus predicted the world will fall after a 'feeble man' rules is **false**. The justification states that a meme circulating in early 2021 depicted a four-line poem supposedly written by Nostradamus, describing a ""feeble man"" ruling with a ""jezebel"" after a plague. Snopes, a fact-checking website, found no evidence of this poem in Nostradamus's published works, ""The Compleat Works of Nostradamus.""  

The meme's interpretation of Nostradamus's work is likely a misinterpretation or a fabricated creation. There is no mention of a ""feeble man"" or a ""jezebel"" in the context of a plague in the original work. Furthermore, Nostradamus's poems are not arranged chronologically, making any specific interpretations based on dates unreliable. 

While Nostradamus is known for his vague predictions that have occasionally seemed to align with historical events, the meme's claim is unsupported and likely based on fabricated information. 
","A four-line poem, also known as a quatrain, allegedly written by 16th-century philosopher Michel de Nostradamus described predictions of a future plague that would fall upon the world. (Some assumed that this so-called plague referred to the COVID-19 pandemic, which Snopes has previously debunked here.)It is unclear where this quatrain originated from or who the original poster was. Nostradamus, who was also a French physician, first published Les Prophties in 1555. It is thought that his collection of poems, which are compiled in 10 sets of verses of 100 quatrains each, contain mythological and astrological predictions for the future world. In the centuries that followed his original publication, he has remained prominent in modern popular culture, often among internet users who share fabricated predictions falsely attributed to him.Nostradamus is credited with accurately predicting many historical events, according to Rare Books Digest. And though many of his poems are largely vague and could apply to a number of events, some of his predictions do come eerily close to actual events.But the meme in question does not appear to make that list. A look through The Compleat Works of Nostradamus did not reveal any mention of a jezebel or a feeble man. And though the word plague was mentioned more than 30 times in the Nostradamus text, there is no instance where it occurs alongside the same wording as in the meme."
"The claim that oil companies are price gouging by comparing oil and gas prices in June 2008 to March 2022 is **false**. While it's true that gas prices haven't immediately followed the drop in oil prices, this isn't evidence of price gouging. 

Here's why:

* **Time Lag:** Gas prices respond to changes in oil prices with a delay. It takes time for gas stations to adjust their prices based on new oil costs, especially considering factors like existing contracts and local market competition.
* **Cherry-Picked Data:** The Facebook post cherry-picked specific oil prices, failing to accurately represent the full range of prices in March 2022. Additionally, it compared a full month of data in 2008 to only half a month in 2022, making the comparison misleading.
* **Different Global Conditions:** The 2008 spike in oil and gas prices was tied to the financial crisis, while the 2022 increase is primarily due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Other factors like inflation, a truck driver shortage, and the oil industry's recovery from the pandemic are also influencing current gas prices.
* **Multiple Factors Impacting Prices:** Gas prices are influenced by various factors beyond just the cost of oil, including state taxes, transportation costs, and local market competition. 

Experts emphasize that the current situation differs significantly from 2008, making direct comparisons inaccurate. Attributing the current high gas prices solely to price gouging by oil companies is an oversimplification and ignores the complex factors at play. 
","By March 14, the price of oil started todrop, but gasoline prices have been slow to follow, prompting some social media users to make comparisons to 2008 and accuse oil and gas companies of price gouging. Thetermis generally used when businesses take advantage of rising demand during a crisis and charge exorbitant prices for necessities.If youre blaming anyone but greedy oil companies for their price gouging, youve bought into propaganda that hurts you more than anyone else, theMarch 14 postsaid.The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

On March 14, WTI crude oil hit a low of $99.76, but the closing price was$103.01.The Facebook post was wrong about prices in June 2008.

"The label ""False"" is accurate because the claim that Genpets are real, genetically engineered animals is not true. The provided justification explains that Genpets are actually sculptures created by artist Adam Brandejs, designed to spark conversations about the potential ethical implications of bioengineering. 

The website www.genpets.com was a deliberate artistic creation meant to mimic an online store selling these fictional pets. The fact that orders could not be placed and the excuse given for this (""Bio-Genica is still developing its connections"") reinforces the point that the website is a fabricated aspect of the artwork, not a legitimate business.

The justification also highlights the artist's intention to use Genpets as a tool for social commentary. The artwork encourages viewers to reflect on the ethics of bioengineering, specifically focusing on the potential exploitation of animals for profit. 
","Although the web site Genpets.com puts on a good show of spoofing an outlet for the sale of ""pre-packaged, bio-engineered pets,"" no such product exists.  One common giveaway: prospective buyers couldn't actually order anything through the (since-removed) Genpets store, with the excuse given that ""Bio-Genica is still developing its connections and relations with resellers while we get the various approvals needed to sell Genpets worldwide."" Like similar items we've been asked about, Genpets are actually artworks  in this case plastic and latex sculptures (including circuitry and robotics) created in 2005 by then 24-year-old Canadian commercial artist Adam Brandejs.

"The label ""NEI"" (Not Enough Information) is appropriate for this claim. While the provided justification does mention a connection between Justice Kennedy's son Justin and Donald Trump's business dealings, the information is largely circumstantial and speculative. 

Here's why the information is insufficient to support the claim:

* **Lack of Direct Evidence:**  The text does not provide any concrete evidence that Trump pressured Kennedy to resign, nor does it reveal any specific actions taken by Trump to influence the timing of Kennedy's retirement.
* **Multiple Interpretations:** The connection between Justin Kennedy and Trump's finances at Deutsche Bank could be coincidental, especially since Justin left the bank before the alleged money laundering activities occurred. The text itself acknowledges that Ruhle, a former Deutsche Bank employee, cautioned against drawing conclusions, emphasizing the complexities of the bank's structure. 
* **Alternative Explanations:**  The justification presents a potential motive for Trump to encourage Kennedy's retirement, but it also outlines the general strategy employed by presidents to take advantage of vacancies on the Supreme Court. This suggests that Kennedy's retirement could have been driven by personal factors or strategic timing unrelated to Trump's influence.

In conclusion, the justification presents a plausible theory but lacks the concrete evidence needed to definitively prove that Trump pressured Kennedy to resign to protect his son. The claim remains unsubstantiated and falls under the category of ""Not Enough Information"". 
","When Justice Anthony M. Kennedy announced his imminent retirement at the end of June 2018, it set the stage for a particularly momentous shift in the makeup of the Supreme Court, as Kennedy had long been the bridge between the court's liberal and conservative sides on a number of contentious social issues: Many critics still smarting over the Republicans' successful (and unprecedented) efforts at blocking approval of Merrick Garland, who had been nominated by outgoing president Barack Obama in 2016 after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia -- thus allowing incoming president Donald Trump the opportunity to fill the vacant court seat instead -- immediately jumped on a conspiracy theory involving the timing of Kennedy's resignation and his son's employment:As the New York Times noted, Donald Trump did have a business relationship with Deutsche Bank, where Justin Kennedy once worked (he left the company in 2009), that went back many years to a time when many other banks were leery of doing business with Trump:And, of course, many news outlets have reported on the potentially suspect coincidence that right about the time Trump was sworn in as U.S. president, Deutsche Bank was fined an aggregate $630 million for their involvement in a $10 billion Russian money-laundering scheme  and Deutsche Bank's records were later reportedly subpoenaed by special prosecutor Robert Muellers investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections:Moreover, Politico reported back in April 2017 (before the Mueller investigation into Russian interference was even underway) that the Trump White House might have been utilizing connections between Trump's and Kennedy's children to ease the elder Kennedy into retirement.  Notably, Politico referenced Justin Kennedy's having a connection with Donald Trump, Jr., not President Trump himself, and made no mention of Deutsche Bank:"
"The statement that Charles Shaw wine was sold cheaply because airlines could no longer use corkscrews after 9/11 and dumped their stocks of wine is **false**.  While this is a popular myth, the real reason behind the low price of Charles Shaw wine was a combination of factors:

* **A wine glut:** The wine boom of the 1990s led to increased production, but a downturn in the US economy and the impact of 9/11 decreased demand, resulting in a surplus of wine. This oversupply caused many wines to sell below the cost of production.
* **Cost-effective production:** Bronco Wine Co., the producer of Charles Shaw wine, uses a highly efficient and cost-effective approach. They source grapes from the Central Valley, which are cheaper than those from Napa Valley, use mechanical harvesting, and own all aspects of the production process, minimizing costs.
* **Marketing strategy:** Bronco Wine Co. strategically positioned Charles Shaw wine as a low-priced option through Trader Joe's, taking advantage of the market conditions and their own cost-effective production to offer a surprisingly affordable wine.

The claim about airlines dumping their wine stocks is a plausible-sounding but ultimately unfounded story that arose because consumers struggled to explain the price difference between Charles Shaw and other, more expensive wines. 
","The Charles Shaw label (known in local slang as ""Two-Buck Chuck"") was the focus of those ""cheap wine"" rumors because it bore a prestigious Napa label, even though it sold for less than $2 per bottle.  The catch was that it's made with cheaper grapes from California's Central Valley rather than more desirable grapes from the Napa Valley, but because the label's parent company does own a winery and bottling facility in Napa, it is allowed to put ""Napa"" on the Charles Shaw label (which only indicates that the wine is ""bottled and cellared"" in Napa) even if the grapes used in the wine actually come from some other part of California:That enmity was famously (albeit accurately) expressed in 2011 by Chris Knox, a self-described vintner who once caustically asserted on Quora, in a since deleted response to an inquiry about why Trader Joe's wine (and the Charles Shaw blend in particular) was sold so cheaply, that those wines were inexpensive to buy because they were ... well, made cheaply:Indeed he was.  Shaw, a Stanford Business School graduate, bought a Napa winery with his wife, Lucy, in 1974 and began to produce Charles Shaw Beaujolais.  However, after the Shaws divorced in 1991, they sold the winery. The Charles Shaw label possessed a good reputation, though, and Bronco Wine Co., a mass-market wine conglomerate located in the Central Valley's Stanislaus County, bought it up and revived it in 2002 for sales of a line of inexpensive wines through the Trader Joe's chain of grocery stores.

"The statement that hunters contribute more than $500 million to West Virginia is **Mostly True**. This figure is based on a 2012 report by Southwick Associates, commissioned by the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) and the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies. 

The report found that hunters spent $421,819,113 in retail sales in West Virginia in 2011. Using a multiplier effect to estimate the total economic impact, the report estimated that hunters contributed a total of $552,085,233 to the state's economy. 

While the report provides evidence to support the governor's claim, it's important to acknowledge some caveats:

* **Outdated Data:** The report is based on 2011 data, meaning the actual economic contribution from hunters may have changed in the subsequent years.
* **Multiplier Effect Uncertainty:** The multiplier effect used to estimate the total economic impact relies on assumptions that could be debated. Using the direct retail sales figure without the multiplier might be more defensible.
* **Industry Funding:** The report was funded by the NSSF, a firearms industry trade association. While the report provides valuable data, it's crucial to consider potential biases associated with industry funding.

Therefore, while the governor's statement is supported by the report's findings, it's important to acknowledge the limitations of the data and the potential for it to be outdated.

"The statement ""Whether you like to admit it or not, half our general revenue goes to education"" is **true**. 

This statement specifically refers to Florida's general revenue, which makes up roughly 34% of the state budget.  In the 2010-2011 fiscal year, $12.5 billion out of $23.8 billion in general revenue was allocated to education (from pre-K through college). This represents over 52% of Florida's general revenue being dedicated to education. 

While Florida's education funding is complex and involves various sources beyond general revenue (like federal funding and local property taxes), Haridopolos' claim is accurate when focusing solely on the general revenue stream.  It highlights how heavily reliant Florida's education system is on this specific portion of the state budget, making cuts to general revenue particularly impactful on education funding. 
","A budget storm is brewing in Tallahassee, and Senate President Mike Haridopolos is making clear that no agency, program or area may be spared from impending cuts.Haridopolos, R-Merritt Island, met with reporters on Jan. 12, 2011, to offer his outlook regarding Florida's $3.62 billion budget shortfall for the coming fiscal year. Haridopolos predicted that it would be difficult to pursue any significant tax cuts -- like those being championed by Gov. Rick Scott -- and that everyone should expect spending cuts.That includes education funding, he warned.More than $3 billion in federal stimulus funds have helped the state fill education budget holes for the past two years, but those funds sunset this spring. And while some additional federal funds are coming available, about $555 million, Florida's budget picture remains bleak, Haridopolos said.Whether you like to admit it or not, half our general revenue goes to education, Haridopolos was quoted as saying in theOrlando Sentinel. It's a very difficult spot to be in, and the reason we wanted to make the adjustments to the class-size amendment defeated by voters in November. Haridopolos was referring to an amendment proposed by the Legislature to ease class-size requirements at Florida schools so the state could save money. That measure failed to receive the needed 60 percent voter approval to pass.For this fact check, we decided to zero in on Haridopolos' claim that half of state general revenue goes to fund education.Understanding the state budget and education fundingIn his claim, Haridopolos is talking about a subset of the state budget, which is a subset of state's share of education funding in Florida, which is a subset of overall education funding in Florida. Oh, and he's not just talking about K-12 spending, but also state spending on the state university system, pre-Kindergarten and student aid programs.We'll walk you through it.Let's start with the state budget, which you can imagine by picturing a three-legged stool.Leg one: General revenue (what Haridopolos is talking about). General revenue makes up about 34 percent of the current state budget. The money mostly comes from sales taxes -- though some comes from telephone and cable taxes, corporate income taxes (which Scott has vowed to phase out), and taxes on property transactions. The state has broad discretion on how general revenue is spent.Leg two: State trust funds. State trust funds make up about 27 percent of the current state budget. That is money collected by the state to be used for a specific purpose. The state gas tax is funneled into a transportation trust fund, for example, to pay for road building projects. Florida Lottery proceeds roll into the Educational Enhancement Trust Fund. (The Legislature, at times, has raided trust funds to help balance the budget.)Leg three: Federal dollars. Federal dollars this year comprise about 39 percent of the state budget. Federal dollars primarily fund the state's Medicaid program, but also help fund education, road projects and the criminal justice system.So while each leg helps fund education programs from pre-K through college, Haridopolos is focusing on the general revenue fund. In the current budget, 56 percent of all state education spending came out of general revenue, and it's the portion of state spending the Legislature can most easily control.Now, here's a second important primer.The state doesn't fund education all by itself. Hardly. Local school districts contribute billions of dollars on their own through local property taxes. Most of those property taxes, believe it or not, are set at rates mandated by the Legislature through something called the Required Local Effort. In short, school districts are forced to collect the amount of property taxes the Legislature decides, or the districts won't get to share in state funding.In addition, there are other property taxes individual school districts have discretion over. None of those funds are technically state revenues for the purpose of this analysis.If this isn't confusing enough already, the context of Haridopolos' statement also is important. He's talking about potential cuts in education funding because of less federal dollars and lower sales tax receipts that are affecting the state's bottom line. One way to offset those cuts would be to raise the Required Local Effort, but the Republican-led Legislature that sets the tax has been opposed to that idea.Drilling down on general revenueNow, sticking to Haridopolos' statement and examining only general revenue, the Senate president is correct.Of the $23.8 billion of general revenue budgeted to be spent between July 1, 2010, and June 30, 2011, $12.5 billion was directed to education -- pre-K through college.Divide one into the other and you see that education spending currently equals more than 52 percent of general revenue. You can see the full breakdown of general revenue spending on Page 5 ofthis report.Haridopolos spokesman David Bishop said the state expects to receive $22.6 billion in general revenue for the 2011-2012 fiscal year.If you look at the overall state budget, education funding made up about 32 percent ($22.4 billion) of the entire $70 billion state budget in 2010-2011."
"The statement ""Candy Crush Saga copied their game from CandySwipe and is attempting to cancel the latter's trademark"" is **True**.  

This claim is supported by the following evidence:

* **Albert Ransom, the creator of CandySwipe, publicly accused King of copying his game.** He wrote an open letter to King, stating that Candy Crush Saga was nearly identical to his game, released two years prior. Ransom also claimed King was attempting to cancel his CandySwipe trademark. 
* **King admitted to acquiring the rights to a game called Candy Crusher.** This was done after Ransom opposed King's attempt to register the trademark for ""Candy Crush."" This suggests King's actions were not just about protecting their own intellectual property but about gaining control over a wider range of candy-related games.
* **King's trademark pursuit of games like ""The Banner Saga"" further indicates their intention to claim ownership of terms like ""saga"" and ""candy.""** This aggressive approach, combined with the allegations of copying CandySwipe, raises serious questions about King's practices.

While King has denied copying CandySwipe and defended their trademark actions, the evidence points to a strong likelihood that they were indeed motivated by the desire to control a broader range of games and trademarks within the candy-themed genre. 
","Synopsis:  As of 16 April 2014, the parties in the dispute discussed below have announced the withdrawal of their claims against each other, so this item is no longer current:Origins:  In February 2014, King Digital Entertainment, the company behind the massively popular Candy Crush Saga game, announced they had filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue an Initial Public Offering (IPO) of stock.  King said they expected to raise $500 million in capital, with some analysts predicting that the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) could value the company as high as $5.5 billion based largely on the strength of Candy Crush Saga:However, King has been the subject of controversy due to similarities between Candy Crush Saga and CandySwipe, the latter being an earlier iteration of a comparable game concept and visual design which its creator, independent developer Albert Ransom, maintains King copied from him.  Ransom posted an open letter to King on the CandySwipe web site, criticizing the company for attempting to wrest theCandySwipe trademark away from him:Ransom's statement was penned in response to King's own open letter on the trademark issue, in which the company maintained that they were simply acquiring ""Candy""-related trademarks in order to ensure that their ""hard work is not simply copied elsewhere"" and to defend their product against ""games with similar sounding titles and similar looking graphics"" (without commenting on the claim that the similar CandySwipe game antedated Candy Crush Saga by about two years and therefore could not have been copied from the latter):Indeed, the modern match-three style puzzler has barely changed at all since the days of Nintendo's Panel De Pon/Tetris Attack in 1995. Although the true originator of the concept is little known PC title Shariki, from a year earlier.The International Game Developers Association (IGDA) has also weighed in on the issue, describing King's trademark efforts as ""overreaching"" and ""predatory"":"
"The claim that a restaurant customer left an anti-immigration note in lieu of a tip is labeled as NEI (Not Enough Information). 

The justification for this label stems from several factors:

* **Unconfirmed Source:** While multiple media outlets reported on the incident, the original source of the photograph of the receipt remains unclear. 
* **No Confirmation from the Accused:** Jason Naglich, the individual named on the receipt, has not responded to media requests for comment. He has neither confirmed nor denied leaving the message. 
* **Lack of Independent Verification:** The restaurant owner's account of the incident is the primary source of information, and there is no independent verification of the note's authenticity.
* **Possible Fabrication:** The possibility of fabrication cannot be ruled out, especially given the history of similar claims in the past where individuals have fabricated such incidents. 

Therefore, while the incident received widespread attention, the evidence presented is insufficient to confirm or deny the veracity of the claim. The lack of confirmation from the accused and independent verification makes it impossible to definitively label the claim as true or false. 
","In November 2015, a photograph began circulating online via sites such Imgur and Facebook showing a restaurant bill from a customer who purportedly stiffed his waitress and mocked her for being an immigrant:The identity of the original friend of a friend who posted the image wasn't clear, but a FoxNews.com article provided some additional information about the circumstances under which the controversy began:An earlier report from Los Angeles television station KNBC included a brief video segment about the ensuing controversy:A report from the Daily Breeze of Los Angeles County's South Bay left it unclear whether the man was a take-out customer or a diner who was waited upon by the server:Searches for Jason Naglich restricted to a few days before the 11 November 2015 date supplied by the restaurant revealed he had no Internet presence of which to speak. How a fellow customer who was not party to the transaction came to view the receipt (as the restaurant claimed) was unclear. The restaurant's owner later said he feared litigation as a result of the controversy.So while the story has drawn massive interest from across the country, little about Naglich and the purported receipt (beyond the original assertion) has been confirmed. It's possible that a diner by that name chose to add insult to injury by stiffing his waitress and blaming it on her immigrant status. It's similarly possible that as with prior claims of this variety, someone somewhere along the line fabricated the slip's message. However, diners swept up in previous hoaxes have quickly spoken up to correct the story once it came to their attention, whereas Naglich has yet to address the rumor."
"The label ""True"" is **Mostly True** because while California's job growth rate did outpace the national average, it wasn't the only state to achieve this. Fourteen other states experienced a higher job growth rate than the national average in 2014. This makes the statement somewhat inaccurate as it implies California was uniquely exceeding national growth when that wasn't the case. 

Furthermore, the claim could be interpreted as stating California's job growth outpaced all other individual states. However, five other states had higher job growth rates than California in 2014, making this interpretation also inaccurate.

Therefore, the statement needs clarification or additional information to be fully accurate. The statement is accurate in the context of California outperforming the national average, but not in the context of outperforming all other states. 
","Top California Democrats like State Senate leader Kevin de Len often claim that the states economy is humming right along  and not weighed down by theirambitiousnew clean energy requirements.So, its not a surprise that De Len, author of the states most recentclean energy law, touted Californias strong job growth during a recent speech abroad about climate change. De Len, D-Los Angeles, spoke about Californias role as a leader in the fight against climate change to members of Parliament in the United Kingdom.He told them California has robust job growth that outpaces the rest of the nation,all while reducing carbon emissions and cleaning up the air we breathe, according to a Novemberpress releasefrom the senators office.Californias employment picture has certainly improved from the Great Recession, when it lostmore than a million jobsfrom 2007 to 2009. Economists credit a rebound in housing and construction jobs plus strong tech sector growth for the states healthier employment figures.In 2014, California added jobs at a 3 percent clip compared with the previous year. That was more than a percentage point higher than the countrys overall rate of 1.9 percent during the same period, according to data from Chapman UniversitysCenter for Economic Research.Asked to clarify the senators statement, De Lens office pointed to recentnews articlesthat describe California adding more total jobs than any other state, and adding jobs at a faster pace than the nation overall.Click here formoreon the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check."
"The label ""True"" is assigned to Portman's claim that Ohio lost over 100,000 jobs since the stimulus package passed.  This is justified by the fact that, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics data up to August 2010, Ohio had lost 149,200 jobs since the stimulus passed. This figure is significantly higher than the 100,000 Portman mentions in his latest advertisement and debate statements. 

Therefore, while his previous claim of 150,000 job losses was rated ""Half True"" due to the available data at the time, his current claim of over 100,000 job losses is deemed ""True"" because the actual job loss number is higher than what he states. 
","PolitiFact has rapped Rob Portman for certain claims made during his U.S. Senate campaign. Weve credited Portman, too, for truthful statements. Thats the nature of the Truth-O-Meter: We play it as it lays.Which brings us to Portmanslatest television ad.In the 30-second spot, Portman points to out-of-control federal spending, dangerous deficits and an economic stimulus plan that he says isnt working. Since the $800 billion stimulus passed, Ohios lost over 100,000 more jobs, Portman says in the commercial.The claim about the stimulus program not working has been batted about repeatedly. The White House said when the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act passed in February 2009, that unemployment would peak at 8 percent. Yet it is now 9.6 percent nationally, and 10.7 percent in Ohio.A number of economists say that even more jobs would have been lost were it not for the government spending to stimulate the economy. TheCongressional Budget Offices last quarterly evaluationsaid the stimulus increased national employment by 1.4 million to 3.3 million jobs. There have been mistakes, missteps and gaffes documented in the spending programs, however, and Portman and other Republicans say the spending was poorly focused. This central question will be for historians and economists in the future to settle.Were merely taking note of Portmans claim because of this: He uses a lower number -- 100,000 jobs lost in Ohio since the stimulus passed -- than he used previously. When he put the figure at 150,000 in June,the Truth-O-Meter ruled it Half True-- because only 127,900 jobs had actually been lost, judging by the most widely accepted measure.That was based on Bureau of Labor Statistics figures through May, the most current at the time.  The numbers come from surveys of employers and are adjusted as the data becomes more complete. Using updated data, BLS now shows the post-stimulus job losses in Ohio came to 130,000 for the period Portman claimed in his earlier statement..But now its October and Portman is using a lower figure when he speaks. As he said in his newest ad, and repeated during an Oct. 8 debate at the City Club of Cleveland, since the stimulus bill passed, Ohios lost over 100,000 more jobs.Yet heres the thing: Portmans rhetoric might actually be too cautious now. As measured by the latest BLS figures, which go through August and are preliminary, Ohio has 149,200 fewer jobs now than when the stimulus passed. Thats exquisitely close to 150,000.What happened?The state steadily lost jobs through 2009 but the numbers started improving early in the year, continuing through May. The summer saw a retraction, however, reducing Ohios employment count by a total of 19,200 jobs during June, July and August.So Portman was accurate and then some with his recent, more cautious statement. The Half True ruling nevertheless stands for his June claim, because PolitiFact doesnt believe in fortune-telling and Portmans numbers were in fact off when he made that statement.But we give credit where credit is due. So the Truth-O-Meter takes a turn to the right and rules on Portmans newest claim: True.Comment on this item."
"The claim that higher education funding in Missouri has been cut or eroded by 35% to 40% since 2001 is **Mostly True**. While the state has actually spent more money on higher education overall, the increase has not kept pace with inflation.  Moreover, when accounting for the significant surge in college enrollment during that period, the amount spent per student has indeed declined by about 34.4%. This means that even though the total budget for higher education has increased in nominal terms, the amount available per student has decreased significantly, effectively eroding the value of the funding. 
","Speaking Aug. 20 at the Missouri State Fair, Koster, a Democrat, reiterated his support for the increasing the cigarette tax,telling the Columbia Daily Tribune: Since 2001, higher education in the state has been cut or allowed to erode  by 35 or 40 percent.In the most recent budget, for fiscal year 2016,$1,266,819,566is set for higher education in Missouri. Thats a 15.9 percent decrease, short of what Koster said.In fall of 2001, Missouris public colleges and universities enrolled143,656 full-time equivalent students. By 2014, enrollment had risen to 184,305 students.In 2001, Missouri spent $10,480.21 per student, adjusting for inflation. Assuming this years enrollment totals track near 2014s (and theresanecdotal evidencesuggesting its not too far off), that would mean the state now spends closer to $6,873 per student."
"The claim that one political party is better at decreasing the number of abortions is **not supported** by the provided justification. While the abortion rate has experienced greater declines during Democratic administrations than Republican ones, this correlation doesn't definitively prove causation. 

The justification points to several key factors:

* **Political factors are complex and don't align neatly with presidential terms.** Policies and legislation enacted during one administration often have long-term impacts that extend beyond their term.
* **State and local events play a significant role.** These factors, not necessarily tied to federal actions, can significantly affect abortion availability and prevalence.
* **The main driver of the declining abortion rate appears to be a broader decrease in pregnancies.** This is likely influenced by a combination of social, cultural, economic, medical, and political factors. 
* **Contraception access and use, declining teen pregnancies, and changing social norms are among the factors contributing to the decrease in pregnancies.** 

The provided justification concludes that while political factors can play a role, it's impossible to definitively attribute the decline in abortions solely to the actions of either political party. 

Therefore, the label **NEI (Not Enough Information)** is appropriate. The claim lacks sufficient evidence to determine whether one party is definitively more effective in decreasing the number of abortions. 
","Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here.As we noted in an earlier article on a similar topic, following the 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision that protected a pregnant woman's liberty to choose to have an abortion without excessive government restriction, the abortion rate rose immediately afterward until it peaked in the 1980s, and it has fairly consistently declined since that peak through presidential administrations of both parties: More important, though, is that we cannot definitively determine to what extent political factors influence the abortion rate. As the Guttmacher Institute (a pro-abortion-rights research organization) observed, recent declines in the abortion rate appear to have been driven not primarily by abortion restrictions but by a broader decline in pregnancies:What's driving that decline in pregnancies, then? We don't know that for sure, either, but likely a combination of social, cultural, economic, medical, and political factors:The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also offered a combination of potential explanations for lower abortion rates:"
"The claim ""Was Carter's peanut farm sold when he assumed the presidency?"" is **NEI** (Not Enough Information). 

While the provided text discusses Jimmy Carter's actions to avoid conflicts of interest upon assuming the presidency, it specifically states that he **placed his peanut farm into a blind trust** in 1977, but **did not sell it until he left office in 1981**. 

Therefore, the claim is partially true but incomplete. Carter did not sell his farm upon assuming the presidency, but rather, he placed it in a blind trust. This action addressed the potential conflict of interest by removing him from direct control of the farm during his presidency. 

The claim is rated as ""Mixture"" because it incorrectly suggests the farm was sold upon taking office, but accurately implies that actions were taken to mitigate potential conflicts of interest. 
","As U.S. President-elect Donald Trump prepared to take office in December 2016, multiple news reports addressed the potential conflicts of interest he would face as he transitioned from a businessman to chief executive. Many critics urged Trump to divest himself of his businesses and cited former U.S. President Jimmy Carter's sale of his peanut farm as an exemplary model of how to head off such potential conflicts:In May 2020, after an appeals court ruled that a lawsuit could proceed alleging that Trump had violated the constitution by receiving foreign money through his hotels, comparisons between Carter and Trump once again gained traction on social media:On Jan. 5, 1977, Carter released a plan detailing how his assets would be handled when he assumed office. Carter listed eight actions that he would take to avoid conflicts of interest, including transferring Carter's Warehouse, Carter Farms, and all funds related to those business ventures into a trust:Carter's business suffered significantly while he served as president, but it wasn't until he left office in 1981 that the decision was made to sell the family farm:If the text of this meme was altered to give Carter's current age, it would still be true. In October 2019, shortly after suffering a fall at his home that required stitches, Carter was back on the construction site.

"Alan Grayson, a Democratic representative from Florida, claimed to be the only member of the House of Representatives who raised the majority of his campaign funds in the last election from small contributions of less than $200.  This claim is **true**.

According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Grayson received $1.8 million in small donations, which constituted 57% of his total campaign funds during the 2013-14 election cycle. This placed him ahead of the second-place finisher, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who received $1.2 million in small donations, equaling 47% of her total contributions.

Therefore, Grayson's claim is supported by factual data and evidence, making it a **true** statement. 
","Grayson, an Orlando Democrat, told a reporter forDemocracy Nowon April 16 that he will probably run in a primary againstU.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy, D-Jupiter, for Marco Rubios Senate seat in 2016. As Democratic Party activists and leaders consider their best path to winning that seat, Grayson wants to remind them of his populist fundraising:(A spokesman for Grayson told PolitiFact Florida that he is likely a few weeks away from making his decision but reiterated that he has said he willprobably run.)In the House for the 2013-14 election cycle, those who received the largest share of their campaign revenue from small contributions were Democrats -- andGraysonwas indeed No. 1, according to a November 2014analysisby the Center for Responsive Politics.The House member who raised the next highest amount in small donations was FloridasDebbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Weston, and head of the Democratic National Committee. She raised $1.2 million in small donations, which equaled 47 percent of her contributions. (Wasserman Schultz recently ruled out running for Senate in 2016.)The third place House finisher wasU.S. Rep. Keith Ellisonof Minnesota who raised about $850,000 in small donations, or 41 percent of his pot.On theSenate sidefor the 2013-14 cycle, Democratic Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota topped the list with $11.7 million in small donations, equaling about 40 percent of his donations.(During his Democracy Now interview, Grayson mentioned U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont as a leader in the Senate in raising small donations. Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats and was re-elected in 2012, raised almost $5 million in small donations, or about61 percent.)Graysons persona as a Democratic firebrand likely contributes to his fundraising abilities. The most successful small-money fundraisers mix media exposure with partisan taunting and ideological appeals,Adam Bonica, a Stanford political science professor, wrote in 2011.Graysonis famous for his provocative taunts against Republicans, such asdescribing the GOPhealth care plan as if you do get sick, die quickly, orcomparing Dick Cheney to a vampire.Michael J. Malbin, director of the Campaign Finance Institute and a political science professor at the University at Albany,saidpolarization alone wont get candidates a lot of money in small donations. In many cases, candidates are tapping into political organizations with an existing network of small donors. Grayson, for example, has received money bundled through ActBlue, an online Democratic fundraising group that focuses on competitive races."
"The claim that an ""increase"" in Arctic and Greenland ice casts doubt on the reality of global warming is **false**. While there was a slight increase in Arctic sea ice extent in 2017 compared to 2012, and Greenland's ice sheet experienced a neutral or small positive change in mass, these isolated events do not negate the overall trend of declining ice. 

The article relies on misleading data points and cherry-picking data, ignoring the long-term trend of Arctic sea ice decline and Greenland's significant ice loss since 2002.  Experts point out that sea ice extent is naturally variable and comparing only two years is not indicative of the larger trend.  Furthermore, the increase in Greenland's ice mass in 2017 was offset by the significant loss of ice from calving, and the overall trend of ice loss in Greenland remains undeniable. 

Climate science relies on long-term data and overall trends, not isolated snapshots in time. Focusing on a single year's fluctuations ignores the significant and consistent evidence of climate change, including rising global temperatures and declining ice volume. 
","On 1 October 2017, pseudoscientific alternative health website NaturalNews.com, which is geared primarily toward supplement enthusiasts with a discerning taste for deep state conspiracy theories, posted an article (""Dont Look Now, But Arctic Sea Ice Mass Has Grown Almost 40% Since 2012"") that attempts to cast doubt on the scientific veracity of global warming by first presenting the following grotesque caricature of a straw man argument:[The Danish Polar Portal reports that]: If we rank the annual surface mass balance since 1981 from low to high, the lowest on record was 2011-2012 (38 Gt) and this year is the 5th highest out of the 37 year record.To be clear, the primary data scientists use to document global warming are records of Earth's temperature over time, not doomed polar bear imagery. Zeke Hausfather, a research scientist for the independent, nongovernmental Berkeley Earth research group told us in an e-mail that, in this area, pretty much ""all groups who provide estimates"" of global temperature unequivocally point to nearly uninterrupted temperature rises since the 1970s, as shown in this comparison of various estimates produced by the climate and energy policy website Carbon Brief:Natural News cites a climate change denial blog called ClimateDepot.com as evidence of the claim that sea ice has grown 40 percent since 2012. In reality, the claim made by this website was more specific and less useful. In a post dated 18 September 2017, Climate Depot stated:""Sea ice extent"" is one of many different metrics used to characterize the presence of sea ice, and is generally defined as ""the area of ocean [based on pixels in satellite imagery] where at least 15 percent of the surface is frozen"". On the day of 17 September 2017, sea ice extent was indeed higher than it was on 17 September 2012:This chart (using data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center) shows September sea ice extent compared against the same average used in the maps cited by Climate Depot, showing both this aforementioned variability but also an overall trend of reduced ice extent. Note that the year 2012 was no random year to select for comparison; it is actually the record lowest year in terms of Arctic sea ice extent  making anything compared to it necessarily higher:The overall trend of declining sea ice is even clearer when you look at a different measure: sea ice volume (presented by the Polar Science Center, below). Not only do such records show a clear negative trend, they also show just how anomalous 2012 was as a data point:In reality, 2017 was the eighth lowest year on record for Arctic sea ice extent since satellite measurements began in 1978. But in no world but the pseudo-scientific fringe internet would the concept of global warming rely on every single year breaking the previous year's record for sea ice minimum.Tom Karl, the former director of NOAAs National Centers for Environmental Information, told us that 2017's sea ice extent was still much lower than the 1980-2010 average (by two standard deviations), and that, despite claims to the contrary, ""one can't look at a trend over 5 years and say much about the impact of global warming as other factors are also important on these short time scales.""The NaturalNews.com approach for glacial ice on Greenland was similarly lacking scale and context. The main source for these arguments was a completely legitimate end-of-year report put out by the Danish Polar Portal, a website run by the Danish Meteorological Institute. In that report, the organization makes this factual statement:This statement, and the figures presented by NaturalNews.com, are referring to a metric known as Surface Mass Balance (SMB), which Polar Portal describes:In a post on Carbon Brief, analysts with the Danish Meteorological Society put this years measurement in context:Like the record of Arctic sea ice earlier, when put in the context of the entire trend of Greenland's ice mass over time (presented by Polar Portal below), 2017's measurement does nothing to change larger and completely unambiguous trends of overall melting: Further, in the case of Greenland's ice sheet, there is not much of a mystery surrounding the lackluster amount of melting this year; a massive storm  the remnants of Hurricane Nicole  parked itself atop the continent, dumping a large amount of snow on the ice-covered continent:"
"The claim that Austin ISD is anticipated to lose over $530 million in local property taxes to the Robin Hood system is **True**. This statement is supported by multiple sources:

* **Austin ISD's own calculations:** Their budget documents show an estimated recapture payment of $533,874,730 for the 2017-18 school year. 
* **Texas Education Agency's preliminary analysis:** While the TEA's estimate is slightly lower at $513,633,317, they acknowledge that this is preliminary and likely to increase based on final data.
* **News reports:** The Austin American-Statesman reported that the Austin ISD board of trustees had approved a budget with a recapture payment of $534 million. 

While the TEA's estimate is slightly lower than the Austin ISD's estimate, the difference is relatively small and the TEA explicitly states their figure is preliminary. Therefore, the claim that Austin ISD is anticipated to lose over $530 million in local property taxes due to the Robin Hood system is accurate. 
","Texas House Speaker Joe Straus hinted at theTexas Houses derailed push for more state education aidby asserting that absent fresh action, Austin taxpayers can count on ponying up more than half a billion dollars to schools in other places this year.The San Antonio Republican prefaced his Austin-centric claim by rehashing his view that Texas overly relies on property taxes to fund the schools. Property taxes are going up, and more and more of those dollars are going to school districts in other parts of the state through the Robin Hood system, Straus said in anemail blastdistributed two days before the July 2017 special session called by Gov. Greg Abbott.Straus was referring to the Robin Hood or recapture facet of state law designed for equalization purposes so districts with rich tax bases share revenue with less property-wealthy districts.

Kirk Watson that in Austin, the average homeowner is paying about $1,300 to $1,400 just for recapture.

"The label ""False"" is accurate because the New American Tea Party, while protesting against federal spending, did not officially endorse the idea of sending tea bags to the White House. 

The justification provides evidence that an email circulating in March 2009 encouraged Americans to mail tea bags to the White House on April 1st or April 15th as a symbolic protest against federal spending. However, a blog entry from the New American Tea Party explicitly states they did not endorse this effort. 

Therefore, although there was a movement within the general public to send tea bags, it was not officially endorsed by the New American Tea Party. 
","In 2009, the iconic status of that event was referenced in the name of the New American Tea Party, described as a ""coalition of citizens and organizations concerned about the recent trend of fiscal recklessness in government"" who have begun coordinating events around the U.S. with the announced goal of protesting largesse in federal spending.   The item quoted above seeks to take up the ""Tea Party"" spirit by encouraging Americans to mail tea bags to the White House on 1 April 2009 (in order to arrive by 15 April, the day on which income tax filings are due) as a form of symbolic protest against ""the way Washington is handling our taxes.""  (The concept is vaguely reminiscent of a 1955 campaign that had citizens mailing small bags of wheat to President Eisenhower to encourage the U.S. to provide surplus food to flood victims in China.) An entry in the New American Tea Party blog states that they don't endorse the effort:(A subsequent New American Tea Party blog entry suggested that just mailing the labels from tea bags might be a way of avoiding this potential pitfall.) Envelopes that cannot be run through USPS sorting machines are subject to an additional 20 postage surcharge. A mailed item is considered  nonmachinable if:"
"The claim states that O.J. Simpson tweeted about his support for the SAG-AFTRA strike. The justification shows that the screenshot of this tweet is fake. It was likely created by Keaton Patti as a joke, and there is no evidence of Simpson actually tweeting about the strike. The justification also shows that the screenshot was created by manipulating a real screenshot from a previous tweet by Simpson, where he shared his views on transgender athletes in sports. 

Therefore, the label ""False"" is accurate. 
","In mid-July 2023, the Screen Actors Guild and American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA), the union representing Hollywood actors and performers, voted to go on strike against major studios after negotiations broke down.A tweet by @KeatonPatti went viral on July 13, 2023, purporting to show a screenshot of a tweet and video in which O.J. Simpson appeared to show his support for the strike. The screenshot shows Simpson wearing a green shirt while standing in front of flowers. An overlaid caption quotes him as saying, ""As a proud SAG member, I can't wait to join you all on the picket line.""Oh no. pic.twitter.com/Cbx0lXJ8w5 Keaton Patti (@KeatonPatti) July 13, 2023However, the screenshot is fake. There is no evidence that Simpson issued such a tweet, nor that he made a video in which he expressed support for the guild strike. The writer Keaton Patti, who has previously written stories for humor sites like The Onion, likely shared this screenshot as a joke. Indeed, the replies to the tweet are largely joking about the impact the spectacle of the controversial figure joining the strikes would have.We went to Simpson's Twitter account, which primarily consists of videos of him sharing his views on a range of topics, but found no tweets in which he expressed support for the strike. The screenshot was likely created by editing a real screenshot from a July 11, 2023, tweet from Simpson titled, ""Sports should be equal and fair,"" in which he shared his views on the inclusion of transgender athletes in sports. In that video, Simpson was shown sitting in front of the same flowers, with the same shirt on, with the camera at the same angle as the one in the manipulated screenshot, and the same reflection in his glasses.Sports should be equal and fair. pic.twitter.com/efsqiDpd7k O.J. Simpson (@TheRealOJ32) July 11, 2023Simpson, a former professional football player, gained notoriety in the 1990s after a sensational trial in which he was acquitted of the murder of his estranged wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman. In 2008, he was found guilty in a botched robbery and sentenced to more than three decades in prison, of which he served nine years.Simpson also produced andactedprofessionally, appearing in ""The Naked Gun"" movie series, among others. His finances fell under scrutiny upon his 2017 release from prison. Tom Scotto, his friend, told USA Today that Simpson received money from a SAG pension, in addition to his National Football League pension and his personal investments in a retirement fund. According to the Hollywood Reporter, Simpson's SAG pension was protected from the millions of dollars he owed to the families of Brown Simpson and Goldman, after they won a wrongful death lawsuit against him in 1997."
"The claim that 101 utilities cut rates and credit GOP tax cuts is **Mostly True**. While the number of utilities cited in the list is accurate, it is important to note that this list only includes investor-owned utilities, which are required by regulations to pass tax savings along to customers. Public utility customers, who make up about one-third of Americans, will not see the same rate cuts. 

The justification for the Mostly True rating lies in the fact that the claim focuses on the tax cuts as the sole reason for the rate cuts, while neglecting the pre-existing regulations that mandate such sharing of savings. Therefore, the claim, while not factually incorrect, presents a skewed perspective by omitting the role of energy regulations in driving these rate reductions.

"The label ""NEI"" (Not Enough Information) is appropriate in this case because, despite the widely reported incident of Ashley Robinson's hair loss after using conditioner, there is no concrete evidence to confirm that the conditioner was tampered with or that the tampering caused her hair loss.  

While Robinson reported a burning sensation and hair loss after using the conditioner, the details surrounding the incident are unclear and contradict each other. 

Here's why the evidence presented doesn't support the claim:

* **Discrepancies in dates and details:**  There are conflicting accounts of when Robinson bought the conditioner. While she initially claimed she bought it two days before the hair loss, later accounts suggested it was five days or even two weeks before.  
* **Lack of evidence of tampering:** Walmart's investigation revealed no evidence of tampering on their surveillance footage, and they found no evidence of Robinson purchasing conditioner in the days leading up to the incident. 
* **Possible alternative explanations:**  The odor Robinson detected in the conditioner could have been due to other factors, and the hair color change could be explained by her hair dye or the lighting in the photos.
* **No other similar incidents:**  The New Richmond police department hasn't received any other reports of product tampering in the area, making this incident seem isolated.

Therefore, while Robinson's experience is concerning, the lack of conclusive evidence regarding product tampering and a causal link between the conditioner and her hair loss makes it impossible to definitively conclude what caused her hair loss. 
","On Aug. 1, the website Distractify published an article under the headline ""Woman Loses Hair After Buying Tampered-With Conditioner That Was Mixed With Nair,"" reporting that:Other reports went beyond the parameters of that single purported incident, claiming without evidence that it was part of a broader trend. The websites Popbuzz and Rare.us both published articles using headlines that stated ""People are Putting Hair Removal Cream in Shampoo,"" while one Twitter user posted a viral tweet that claimed ""people"" were mixing Nair into shampoo and conditioner bottles:Please check your hair products before you buy them, people are mixing Nair into shampoo & conditioner in the store smh pic.twitter.com/iCuDpZLpmL ???? ??????? (@shandiditbetter) July 30, 2019Later that night, Robinson herself posted the same photograph of black hair, along with a brief account of what had happened earlier that evening:Robinson said she visited the emergency room due to a burning sensation and was later discharged. The following evening, she wrote on Facebook that she had undergone a ""consultation"" but had resigned herself to having to shave her head. On July 30, Robinson posted a photograph of herself bald, and on Aug. 1, Minneapolis television station WCCO interviewed her:On Aug. 1, the New Richmond Police Department announced they had opened an investigation into potential product tampering after having received a formal complaint about Robinson's experience. Their news release on the subject stated that:This is potentially a significant finding. Robinson, in her July 28 Facebook post, asserted that she quickly realized something had gone awry in washing her hair because she could detect the odor of another substance in her conditioner (""something was different and didnt smell the greatest,"" ""I took my hair out of the towel and it smelt terrible""). Courtesy of Taffy Jo Timm.Robinson later posted to Facebook a photograph of herself with dyed hair, which she said was taken the day before her hair loss began, and various photographs on her Facebook account demonstrated that she did indeed periodically dye her hair."
"The image comparing the net worths of former and current presidents is misleading because it fails to account for the unique circumstances of each individual. It compares the wealth of former presidents, who have had years to build their fortunes after leaving office, with the wealth of the current president, who is still in office and thus limited in his ability to engage in lucrative business ventures. The claim that the image reveals something significant is therefore unsubstantiated.  Furthermore, the comparison does not consider the historical trend of former presidents increasing their wealth after leaving office.  

The image also omits information that contradicts its intended message. For instance, it neglects to mention that former presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, both Republicans, also saw significant increases in their net worths after their presidencies. 

Finally, the image implies that the presidents' financial gains are a result of illicit activities, but the text explicitly clarifies that no accusations of corruption or theft have been made against any of the presidents mentioned. 
","The Clintons' net worth was as reported as $700,000 in their 1992 statement, the Obamas' net worth was estimated at about $1.3 million in 2007 (mostly derived from book publishing advances and royalties), while the Trumps' net worth was pegged at $3.7 billion in 2016.As of 2017, the Clintons were estimated to have made $240 million since Bill Clinton left office in 2001, the Obamas' combined net worth was reckoned to be about $24 million, while the Trumps' net worth was thought to have dropped to about $3.1 billion. Suffice it to say that the Clinton and Obama families have done very well for themselves since leaving the White House, but the Trumps have realized no similar windfall (and have possibly seen their overall wealth decline a bit).More important, though, is that former Presidents Clinton and Obama are former presidents who have returned to private life, and thus they can avail themselves of many money-making opportunities common to ex-presidents -- writing books, giving speeches, consulting for private companies, holding board seats, advising businessmen and politicians -- that are simply not available to a sitting president. But for the incumbent chief executive, the position of President of the United States affords its holder little time to manage any outside business interests, and conflict of interest laws make it difficult for presidents to engage in profitable business ventures while they're serving as public officials. (Most sitting presidents choose to put their business interests into blind trusts or otherwise delegate their day-to-day management to others during their terms of office.)"
"The claim that Walt Disney was born in Robinson, Illinois is **false**. 

The provided justification thoroughly debunks the claim by presenting several key points:

* **Contradiction with established facts:** All reliable biographies and records state that Walt Disney was born in Chicago, contradicting the claim made in the Robinson Argus newspaper. 
* **Lack of corroboration:** If Walt Disney had publicly stated he was born in Robinson to a prominent reporter like Edward R. Murrow, it is highly unlikely this fact would have been omitted from all major biographies.
* **Timeline inconsistencies:**  The story presented in the Robinson Argus contradicts known facts about the Disney family. Walt's parents had been living in Chicago continuously since 1889, and there's no record of them traveling to Robinson or having a fourth child born there.
* **Implausible circumstances:** The story claims the Disneys traveled to Robinson with three young children, while Mrs. Disney was about to give birth to a fourth. It is highly improbable that they would have undertaken such a trip under these circumstances. 
* **Misinformation regarding Walt's fame:** The story claims Walt Disney was ""coming into great popularity"" in 1925-26, but Mickey Mouse, his most famous character, hadn't yet debuted.
* **Birth records evidence:**  The birth certificate of Walt's brother Raymond Arnold Disney, born in 1890, indicates that the family had considered naming one of their sons ""Walter,"" proving they had the name in mind long before Walt's birth in 1901.

Therefore, the justification clearly demonstrates that the claim of Walt Disney's birth in Robinson, Illinois is based on a fabricated story. It's more likely a case of someone trying to associate themselves with fame, rather than a genuine historical fact. 
"," The statement that Walt Disney was ""coming into great popularity"" in 1925-26 (a claim made to explain why the narrator clearly remembered a story she'd been told over fifty years earlier  obviously she wouldn't have found the tale so memorable if Walt Disney wasn't already famous when she heard it) is a bit off the mark: the debut of the character who made the name 'Disney' a household word, Mickey Mouse, was still several years in the future, and even Disney's first successful animated character, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, would not first appear until late 1927.  Disney had moderate success in the mid-1920s with his Alice in Cartoonland series (short silent films which mixed live action and animation), but he was hardly a nationally-known figure in 1926.  (As a point of comparison, we note that although Disney began working in Los Angeles in early 1923, his name appeared in the pages of the Los Angeles Times but once prior to 1929.)"
"The claim that Alex Trebek's wealth brought his family to tears is **false**.  

The justification explains that this claim was part of a misleading online advertisement campaign designed to attract clicks and generate revenue through ""arbitrage"".  These ads, appearing shortly after Trebek's death, falsely suggested that his net worth left his family in distress. This claim is contradicted by Jean Trebek's heartfelt Instagram post expressing gratitude for the outpouring of support and compassion following her husband's passing. 

The article further details the structure of this advertising scheme, highlighting how it uses slideshows with numerous pages featuring celebrity net worths, with Trebek's being positioned near the end after numerous clicks. This manipulative tactic aims to mislead viewers into clicking through a multitude of ads to reach the supposed information about Trebek's wealth, ultimately generating profit for the advertisers. 
","Alex Trebek's net worth became the subject of strange online advertisements in the weeks following his death. The husband, father, and ""Jeopardy"" game show host died on Nov. 8, 2020, following a battle with advanced pancreatic cancer. Misleading, baseless, and false.The ads were sponsored by LifeExact, The Financial Mag, Travel Patriot, and perhaps others, and were routed through Zemanta, which is owned by Outbrain. Crunchbase defined Outbrain as ""a content discovery platform providing publishers a service for recommended links to increase traffic and generate revenue."" Outbrain (via Zemanta) provided the technology that allowed the Trebek ads to appear, while LifeExact, The Financial Mag, and Travel Patriot hosted the landing pages. The landing pages featured an image slideshow, with one celebrity name and net worth figure per page. The slideshow story was headlined as: ""52 Celebrities & Their Huge Net Worth  Chadwick Boseman's Net Worth Left Us in Disbelief.""The ""net worth left family in tears"" advertising lure has also been used by advertising networks exploiting the names of Kenny Rogers, Sean Connery, and Pat Sajak. However, Sajak is still alive, and as of this writing is on the first page of the ""52 Celebrities"" slideshow.While the headline claimed the story was about 52 celebrities, including Chadwick Boseman, who died on Aug. 28, 2020, Boseman did not show up until after 140 clicks, on slide 140. Trebek appeared after 141 clicks, on slide 141. His page was the end of the slideshow. Trebek's page did not appear to acknowledge his cancer or passing. The page, which claimed his net worth was $50 million, was likely created in the past, and may have been moved along with Boseman's page to the end of the 141-page slideshow after their deaths.The one-item-per-click slideshow model is known in the online advertising world as ""arbitrage."" On the business and technology blog Margins, run by Ranjan Roy and Can Duruk, Roy defined arbitrage as ""leveraging an inefficient set of systems to make a riskless profit, usually by buying and selling the same asset."" He also called it ""the mythical free lunch that economics tells us does not exist.""As the family grieved Trebek's passing, on Nov. 11, his wife, Jean, shared a heartfelt message with a photograph from their wedding day. She posted to Instagram:Snopes debunks a wide range of content, and online advertisements are no exception. Misleading ads often lead to obscure websites that host lengthy slideshow articles with lots of pages. It's called advertising ""arbitrage.""

"The claim that NASA data shows global warming isn't causing sea level rise is **false**. While Natural News points to a short-term dip in sea level data as evidence against global warming, this dip is not a new phenomenon and is easily explained by natural fluctuations in climate. 

Specifically, the dip in sea level data is attributed to a number of factors, including:

* **El Niño-La Niña cycle:** This cycle affects water temperatures, evaporation, and precipitation patterns, which can impact sea level.  The dip in sea level data coincides with the end of an El Niño event, which is known to cause temporary dips in sea level as water is drawn from the ocean to land. 
* **Hydrological events:**  The significant rainfall in Australia during the period in question resulted in water being stored on land, further contributing to the temporary sea level decrease.

These natural variations are well-understood and do not contradict the long-term trend of rising sea levels driven by global warming. The long-term trend is driven by the melting of glaciers and ice sheets and the expansion of water as it warms.  These factors are scientifically established and have been observed over decades.

In conclusion, focusing on a short-term dip in sea level data while ignoring the long-term trend is misleading and inaccurate. The claim that NASA data disproves global warming is a misrepresentation of the data and the scientific understanding of climate change. 
","On 26 July 2017, supplement and paranoia peddling website NaturalNews.com made a sweeping conclusion about climate change based on a portion of a single chart they found. The post, by Mike ""Health Ranger"" Adams, uses a time series of satellite sea level data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to argue that climate change is no big deal and that the mainstream media is ignoring data that proves him right: The NASA chart allegedly showing that sea level is not rising. Credit: NASA.To understand why the event is not noteworthy, one needs to understand both the short- and long-term drivers of sea level change. From a long-term global perspective, there are two primary drivers of sea level rise: the first is the balance between water trapped in ice and water contained within the ocean itself. Simply put, when ice that is trapped on land melts, it increases the volume of water in the ocean, causing sea level to rise.The second major driver is known as thermal expansion  when water gets warmer it expands, increasing its volume. Research suggests that these two contributors alone explain 75 percent of the observed sea level rise since 1971.These larger trends, however, can be dampened (or enhanced) by shorter term weather patterns. The most important factors to consider on this time-scale are the El Nio-La Nia cycle (which affects both water temperature, as well as evaporation and precipitation of moisture) and the hydrological issues associated with where rainwater falls on land. The best illustration of these factors combining to alter the overall trend of sea level rise is the 2010-2011 drop in sea level mentioned above.In this instance, the confluence of La Nia and a number of other atmospheric circulation patterns forced an anomalously large amount of rain to fall over the uniquely bowl-shaped continent of Australia, as described by Scientific American:"
"The claim that Barack Obama mandated banks to provide loans to individuals with low income is **not supported by the evidence**. The provided information shows that Obama was involved in a 1994 class-action lawsuit against Citibank, but this lawsuit focused on the discriminatory practice of **redlining**, not on forcing banks to provide loans to low-income individuals regardless of their creditworthiness. 

The lawsuit, *Buycks-Roberson v. Citibank Fed. Sav. Bank*, was brought by a Black woman, Selma Buycks-Roberson, who alleged she was unfairly denied a mortgage based on her race. The lawsuit challenged Citibank's practice of denying loans to minority applicants while approving loans for white applicants with similar financial backgrounds. This practice, known as redlining, targets specific neighborhoods based on race and socioeconomic status, preventing residents from accessing essential services like loans and mortgages. 

While Obama was a junior lawyer on the team representing the plaintiffs, the case focused on ending racial discrimination in lending practices, not on forcing banks to provide loans to everyone regardless of their ability to repay. The claim that Obama mandated banks to provide loans to low-income individuals is a distortion of his involvement in the *Buycks-Roberson* case, which aimed to ensure fair and equal access to credit regardless of race. 
","The 1994 case of Buycks-Roberson v. Citibank Fed. Sav. Bank had nothing to do with requiring lenders to do business with people ""who could not show proof that they could pay the money back.""  The case was a class-action lawsuit against Citibank Federal Savings initiated by a black Chicago woman, Selma Buycks-Roberson, who claimed she was unfairly denied a mortgage based on her race.  The lawsuit sought to end the practice of redlining, a discriminatory practice by which banks, insurance companies, and other business institutions refuse or limit loans, mortgages, insurance, etc., based solely on the geographic area in which the applicant lives (a practice that commonly excludes minorities in inner-city neighborhoods, regardless of their income or ability to pay).  Specifically, the lawsuit charged that Citibank ""rejected loan applications of minority applicants while approving loan applications filed by white applicants with similar financial characteristics and credit histories.""  The case was eventually settled out of court, with some class members receiving cash payments and Citibank agreeing to help ease the way for low- and moderate-income people to apply for mortgages."
